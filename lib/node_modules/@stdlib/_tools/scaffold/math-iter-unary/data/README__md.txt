## Usage

```javascript
var {{ALIAS}} = require( '@{{PKG}}' );
```

#### {{ALIAS}}( iterator )

{{MAIN_DESC}}

```javascript
var array2iterator = require( '@stdlib/array/to-iterator' );

var it = {{ALIAS}}( array2iterator( [ {{VALUES_LEN_2}} ] ) );
// returns <Object>

var v = it.next().value;
// returns {{EXPECTED_1}}

v = it.next().value;
// returns {{EXPECTED_2}}

// ...
```

The returned [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object has the following properties:

-   **next**: function which returns an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object containing the next iterated value (if one exists) assigned to a `value` property and a `done` property having a boolean value indicating whether the iterator is finished.
-   **return**: function which closes an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] and returns a single (optional) argument in an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object.

## Notes

-   If an iterated value is non-numeric (including `NaN`), the returned [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] returns `NaN`. If non-numeric iterated values are possible, you are advised to provide an [`iterator`][mdn-iterator-protocol] which type checks and handles non-numeric values accordingly.
-   If an environment supports `Symbol.iterator` **and** a provided [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] is iterable, the returned [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] is iterable.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var random = require( '@stdlib/random/iter/{{BASE_PRNG}}' );
var {{ALIAS}} = require( '@{{PKG}}' );

// Create a seeded iterator for generating pseudorandom numbers:
var rand = random( {{RAND_MIN}}, {{RAND_MAX}}, {
    'seed': 1234,
    'iter': 10
});

// Create an iterator which consumes the pseudorandom number iterator:
var it = {{ALIAS}}( rand );

// Perform manual iteration...
var v;
while ( true ) {
    v = it.next();
    if ( v.done ) {
        break;
    }
    console.log( v.value );
}
```
