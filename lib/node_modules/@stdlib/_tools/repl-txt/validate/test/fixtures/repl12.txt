{{alias}}( [buffer,] [options] )
    Returns a multidimensional array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    buffer: Array|TypedArray|Buffer|ndarray (optional)
        Data source.

    options: Object (optional)
        Options.

    options.buffer: Array|TypedArray|Buffer|ndarray (optional)
        Data source. If provided along with a `buffer` argument, the argument
        takes precedence.

    options.dtype: string (optional)
        Underlying storage data type. If not specified and a data source is
        provided, the data type is inferred from the provided data source. If an
        input data source is not of the same type, this option specifies the
        data type to which to cast the input data. For non-ndarray generic array
        data sources, the function casts generic array data elements to the
        default data type. In order to prevent this cast, the `dtype` option
        must be explicitly set to `'generic'`. Any time a cast is required, the
        `copy` option is set to `true`, as memory must be copied from the data
        source to an output data buffer. Default: 'float64'.

    options.order: string (optional)
        Specifies the memory layout of the data source as either row-major (C-
        style) or column-major (Fortran-style). The option may be one of the
        following values:

        - 'row-major': the order of the returned array is row-major.
        - 'column-major': the order of the returned array is column-major.
        - 'any': if a data source is column-major and not row-major, the order
          of the returned array is column-major; otherwise, the order of the
          returned array is row-major.
        - 'same': the order of the returned array matches the order of an input
          data source.

        Note that specifying an order which differs from the order of a
        provided data source does *not* entail a conversion from one memory
        layout to another. In short, this option is descriptive, not
        prescriptive. Default: 'row-major'.

    options.shape: Array<integer> (optional)
        Array shape (dimensions). If a shape is not specified, the function
        attempts to infer a shape based on a provided data source. For example,
        if provided a nested array, the function resolves nested array
        dimensions. If provided a multidimensional array data source, the
        function uses the array's associated shape. For most use cases, such
        inference suffices. For the remaining use cases, specifying a shape is
        necessary. For example, provide a shape to create a multidimensional
        array view over a linear data buffer, ignoring any existing shape meta
        data associated with a provided data source.

    options.flatten: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating whether to automatically flatten generic array data
        sources. If an array shape is not specified, the shape is inferred from
        the dimensions of nested arrays prior to flattening. If a use case
        requires partial flattening, partially flatten prior to invoking this
        function and set the option value to `false` to prevent further
        flattening during invocation. Default: true.

    options.copy: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating whether to (shallow) copy source data to a new data
        buffer. The function does *not* perform a deep copy. To prevent
        undesired shared changes in state for generic arrays containing objects,
        perform a deep copy prior to invoking this function. Default: false.

    options.ndmin: integer (optional)
        Specifies the minimum number of dimensions. If an array shape has fewer
        dimensions than required by `ndmin`, the function prepends singleton
        dimensions to the array shape in order to satisfy the dimensions
        requirement. Default: 0.

    options.casting: string (optional)
        Specifies the casting rule used to determine acceptable casts. The
        option may be one of the following values:

        - 'none': only allow casting between identical types.
        - 'equiv': allow casting between identical and byte swapped types.
        - 'safe': only allow "safe" casts.
        - 'same-kind': allow "safe" casts and casts within the same kind (e.g.,
          between signed integers or between floats).
        - 'unsafe': allow casting between all types (including between integers
          and floats).

        Default: 'safe'.

    options.codegen: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating whether to use code generation. Code generation can
        boost performance, but may be problematic in browser contexts enforcing
        a strict content security policy (CSP). Default: true.

    options.mode: string (optional)
        Specifies how to handle indices which exceed array dimensions. The
        option may be one of the following values:

        - 'throw': an ndarray instance throws an error when an index exceeds
          array dimensions.
        - 'wrap': an ndarray instance wraps around indices exceeding array
          dimensions using modulo arithmetic.
        - 'clamp', an ndarray instance sets an index exceeding array dimensions
          to either `0` (minimum index) or the maximum index.

        Default: 'throw'.

    options.submode: Array<string> (optional)
        Specifies how to handle subscripts which exceed array dimensions. If a
        mode for a corresponding dimension is equal to

        - 'throw': an ndarray instance throws an error when a subscript exceeds
          array dimensions.
        - 'wrap': an ndarray instance wraps around subscripts exceeding array
          dimensions using modulo arithmetic.
        - 'clamp': an ndarray instance sets a subscript exceeding array
          dimensions to either `0` (minimum index) or the maximum index.

        If the number of modes is fewer than the number of dimensions, the
        function recycles modes using modulo arithmetic.

        Default: [ options.mode ].

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        Multidimensional array.

    Examples
    --------
    // Create a 2x2 matrix:
    > var arr = {{alias}}( [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ] ] )
    <ndarray>

    // Get an element using subscripts:
    > var v = arr.get( 1, 1 )
    4.0

    // Get an element using a linear index:
    > v = arr.iget( 3 )
    4.0

    // Set an element using subscripts:
    > arr.set( 1, 1, 40.0 );
    > arr.get( 1, 1 )
    40.0

    // Set an element using a linear index:
    > arr.iset( 3, 99.0 );
    > arr.get( 1, 1 )
    99.0
