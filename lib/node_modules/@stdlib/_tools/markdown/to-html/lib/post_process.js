/**
* Applies post-processing to output HTML.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   The need for this function stems from rehype and how it treats foreign namespaces in HTML. For background, see the following issues:
*
*     -   <https://github.com/rhysd/rehype-react/issues/5>
*     -   <https://github.com/wooorm/rehype/issues/2>
*     -   <https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast/issues/6>
*
* -   **WARNING**: this function is ad-hoc, undoubtedly not comprehensive, and will inevitably have to be updated as additional issues arise.
*
* @private
* @param {string} html - HTML to process
* @returns {string} output HTML
