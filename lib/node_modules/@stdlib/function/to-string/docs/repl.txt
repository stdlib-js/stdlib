{{alias}}( fcn )
    Returns a string representing the source code of a provided function.

    If called on built-in functions, functions created by `Function#bind()`, or
    other non-JavaScript functions, the function returns a "native" function
    string similar to the following:

      "function foo() { [native code] }"

    For intrinsic object methods and functions, `foo` is the initial name of the
    function.

    If called on a function created by the `Function` constructor, the function
    returns the source code of a synthesized function declaration having the
    name "anonymous" and using the provided parameters and function body.

    Starting in ES2018, the ECMAScript specification requires that the returned
    string contain the exact same source code as it was declared, including any
    whitespace and/or comments. If the host is unable to access the source code,
    the specification requires that the returned string be the native function
    string.

    out: string
        String representing the function's source code.
