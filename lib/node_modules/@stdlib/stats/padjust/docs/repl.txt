{{alias}}( pvals, method[, comparisons] )
    Adjusts supplied p-values for multiple comparisons via a specified method.

    The `method` parameter can be one of the following values:

    - bh: Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling the False Discovery
    Rate (FDR).
    - bonferroni: Bonferroni correction fixing the family-wise error rate
    by multiplying the p-values with the number of comparisons. The Bonferroni
    correction is usually a too conservative adjustment compared to the others.
    - by: Procedure by Benjamini & Yekutieli for controlling the False
    Discovery Rate (FDR) under dependence.
    - holm: Hommel's method controlling family-wise error rate. It is
    uniformly more powerful than the Bonferroni correction.
    - hommel: Hommel's method, which is valid when hypothesis tests are
    independent. It is more expensive to compute than the other methods.

    By default, the number of comparisons for which the p-values should be
    corrected is equal to the number of provided p-values. Alternatively, it is
    possible to set `comparisons` to a number greater than the length of
    `pvals`. In that case, the methods assume `comparisons - pvals.length`
    unobserved p-values that are greater than all observed p-values (for Holm's
    method and the Bonferroni correction) or equal to `1` for the remaining
    methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvals: Array<number>
        P-values to be adjusted.

    method: string
        Correction method.

    comparisons: integer (optional)
        Number of comparisons. Default value: `pvals.length`.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<number>
        Array containing the corrected p-values.

    Examples
    --------
    > var pvalues = [ 0.008, 0.03, 0.123, 0.6, 0.2 ];
    > var out = {{alias}}( pvalues, 'bh' )
    [ 0.04, 0.075, ~0.205, 0.6, 0.25 ]

    > out = {{alias}}( pvalues, 'bonferroni' )
    [ 0.04, 0.15, 0.615, 1.0, 1.0 ]

    > out = {{alias}}( pvalues, 'by' )
    [ ~0.457, ~0.856, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ]

    > out = {{alias}}( pvalues, 'holm' )
    [ 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ]

    > out = {{alias}}( pvalues, 'hommel' )
    [ 0.16, 0.6, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ]
