# itermidrange

> Compute the [mid-range][mid-range] of all [iterated][mdn-iterator-protocol] values.

<section class="intro">

The [**mid-range**][mid-range], or **mid-extreme**, is the arithmetic mean of maximum and minimum values. Accordingly, the [mid-range][mid-range] is the midpoint of the [range][range] and a measure of central tendency.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var itermidrange = require( '@stdlib/stats/iter/midrange' );
```

#### itermidrange( iterator )

Computes the [mid-range][mid-range] of all [iterated][mdn-iterator-protocol] values.

```javascript
var array2iterator = require( '@stdlib/array/to-iterator' );

var arr = array2iterator( [ 1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0 ] );

var v = itermidrange( arr );
// returns -0.5
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If an iterated value is non-numeric (including `NaN`), the returned [`iterator`][mdn-iterator-protocol] returns `NaN`. If non-numeric iterated values are possible, you are advised to provide an [`iterator`][mdn-iterator-protocol] which type checks and handles non-numeric values accordingly.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var runif = require( '@stdlib/random/iter/uniform' );
var itermidrange = require( '@stdlib/stats/iter/midrange' );

// Create an iterator for generating uniformly distributed pseudorandom numbers:
var rand = runif( -10.0, 10.0, {
    'seed': 1234,
    'iter': 100
});

// Compute the mid-range:
var v = itermidrange( rand );
// returns <number>

console.log( 'mid-range: %d.', v );
```
