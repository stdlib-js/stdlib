# Studentized Range

> Studentized range distribution.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var tukey = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/studentized-range' );
```

#### tukey

[Studentized range][studentized-range] distribution.

```javascript
var dist = tukey;
// returns {...}
```

The namespace contains the following distribution functions:

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var tukey = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/studentized-range' );

/*
* Let's consider an example where we are analyzing the test scores of students in a class.
* We're interested in using the Studentized Range Distribution to analyze the range of scores.
* The distribution has parameters: r (number of means), v (degrees of freedom), and nranges (number of ranges).
*/

var r = 5.0;
var v = 20.0;
var nranges = 3.0;

// CDF can be used to calculate the cumulative distribution function at a specific value:
var out = tukey.cdf( 2.0, r, v, nranges );
// returns ~0.074

// Quantile can also be used to calculate the quantile function at a specific probability:
out = tukey.quantile( 0.9, r, v, nranges );
// returns ~4.433
