// Mean can be used to calculate the mean of the distribution:

// Standard deviation can be used to calculate the standard deviation of the distribution:
console.log(levy.stdev(mu, c));
// => Infinity

// Variance can be used to calculate the variance of the distribution:
console.log(levy.variance(mu, c));
// => Infinity

// PDF can be used to calculate the probability density function at a specific value:
console.log(levy.pdf(1, mu, c));
// => ~0.242

// CDF can be used to calculate the cumulative distribution function at a specific value:
console.log(levy.cdf(2, mu, c));
// => ~0.480

// Quantile can be used to calculate the quantile function at a specific probability:
console.log(levy.quantile(0.8, mu, c));
// => ~15.580
