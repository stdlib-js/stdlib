## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var uniform = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/uniform' );

/*
Let's consider an example where we are modeling the arrival times of guests
at a reception event that runs from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, where each arrival
within this 2-hour window is equally likely. We can model this scenario using a
continuous  uniform distribution with a minimum value of 0 (6:00 PM) and
a maximum value of 120 (8:00 PM).
*/

var min = 0.0; // 6:00 PM is 0 minutes after 6:00 PM.
var max = 120.0; // 8:00 PM is 120 minutes after 6:00 PM.

var mean = uniform.mean( min, max );
// returns 60.0

var variance = uniform.variance( min, max );
// returns 1200.0

var stdDev = uniform.stdev( min, max );
// returns ~34.641

var entropy = uniform.entropy( min, max );
// returns ~4.787

// Probability of arrival within 30 minutes after 6:00 PM:
var p = uniform.cdf( 30, min, max );
// returns 0.25

// Evaluate the PDF at 30 minutes after 6:00 PM:
var pdf = uniform.pdf( 30, min, max );
// returns ~0.0083
