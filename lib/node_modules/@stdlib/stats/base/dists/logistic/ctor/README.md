## Usage

```javascript
var Logistic = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/logistic/ctor' );
```

#### Logistic( \[mu, s] )

Returns a [logistic][logistic-distribution] distribution object.

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic();

var mu = logistic.mean;
// returns 0.0
```

By default, `mu = 0.0` and `s = 1.0`. To create a distribution having a different `mu` (location parameter) and `s` (scale parameter), provide the corresponding arguments.

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var mu = logistic.mean;
// returns 2.0
```

* * *

## logistic

A [logistic][logistic-distribution] distribution object has the following properties and methods...

### Writable Properties

#### logistic.mu

Location parameter of the distribution.

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic();

var mu = logistic.mu;
// returns 0.0

logistic.mu = 3.0;

mu = logistic.mu;
// returns 3.0
```

#### logistic.s

Scale parameter of the distribution. `s` **must** be a positive number.

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var s = logistic.s;
// returns 4.0

logistic.s = 3.0;

s = logistic.s;
// returns 3.0
```

* * *

### Computed Properties

#### Logistic.prototype.entropy

Returns the [differential entropy][entropy].

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 4.0, 12.0 );

var entropy = logistic.entropy;
// returns ~4.485
```

#### Logistic.prototype.kurtosis

Returns the [excess kurtosis][kurtosis].

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 4.0, 12.0 );

var kurtosis = logistic.kurtosis;
// returns 1.2
```

#### Logistic.prototype.mean

Returns the [expected value][expected-value].

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 4.0, 12.0 );

var mu = logistic.mean;
// returns 4.0
```

#### Logistic.prototype.median

Returns the [median][median].

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 4.0, 12.0 );

var median = logistic.median;
// returns 4.0
```

#### Logistic.prototype.mode

Returns the [mode][mode].

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 4.0, 12.0 );

var mode = logistic.mode;
// returns 4.0
```

#### Logistic.prototype.skewness

Returns the [skewness][skewness].

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 4.0, 12.0 );

var skewness = logistic.skewness;
// returns 0.0
```

#### Logistic.prototype.stdev

Returns the [standard deviation][standard-deviation].

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 4.0, 12.0 );

var s = logistic.stdev;
// returns ~21.766
```

#### Logistic.prototype.variance

Returns the [variance][variance].

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 4.0, 12.0 );

var s2 = logistic.variance;
// returns ~473.741
```

* * *

### Methods

#### Logistic.prototype.cdf( x )

Evaluates the [cumulative distribution function][cdf] (CDF).

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var y = logistic.cdf( 0.5 );
// returns ~0.407
```

#### Logistic.prototype.logcdf( x )

Evaluates the natural logarithm of the [cumulative distribution function][cdf] (CDF).

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var y = logistic.logcdf( 2.0 );
// returns ~-0.693
```

#### Logistic.prototype.logpdf( x )

Evaluates the natural logarithm of the [probability density function][pdf] (PDF).

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var y = logistic.logpdf( 0.8 );
// returns ~-2.795
```

#### Logistic.prototype.mgf( t )

Evaluates the [moment-generating function][mgf] (MGF).

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var y = logistic.mgf( 0.2 );
// returns ~6.379
```

#### Logistic.prototype.pdf( x )

Evaluates the [probability density function][pdf] (PDF).

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var y = logistic.pdf( 2.0 );
// returns 0.0625
```

#### Logistic.prototype.quantile( p )

Evaluates the [quantile function][quantile-function] at probability `p`.

```javascript
var logistic = new Logistic( 2.0, 4.0 );

var y = logistic.quantile( 0.5 );
// returns 2.0

y = logistic.quantile( 1.9 );
// returns NaN
```
