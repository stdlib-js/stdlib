## Usage

```javascript
var mean = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/degenerate/mean' );
```

#### mean( mu )

Returns the [expected value][expected-value] of a [degenerate][degenerate-distribution] distribution with constant value `mu`.

```javascript
var v = mean( 10.0 );
// returns 10.0

v = mean( -0.5 );
// returns -0.5
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/base/randu' );
var mean = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/degenerate/mean' );

var mu;
var v;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    mu = randu();
    v = mean( mu );
    console.log( 'µ: %d, E(X;µ): %d', mu.toFixed( 4 ), v.toFixed( 4 ) );
}
