	gen( x, n, p, name )

Generate fixture data and write to file.

# Arguments

* `x`: input value
* `n`: number of trials
* `p`: success probability
* `name::AbstractString`: output filename

# Examples

``` julia
julia> x = round.( rand( 1000 ) .* 15.0 );
julia> n = round.( rand( 1000 ) .* 20.0 );
julia> p = rand( 1000 );
julia> gen( x, n, p, \"data.json\" );
