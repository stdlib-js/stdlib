## Usage

```javascript
var mean = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/t/mean' );
```

#### mean( v )

Returns the [expected value][expected-value] of a [Student's t][t-distribution] distribution with degrees of freedom `v`.

```javascript
var y = mean( 9.0 );
// returns 0.0

y = mean( 1.5 );
// returns 0.0
```

If provided `v <= 1`, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var y = mean( -1.0 );
// returns NaN

y = mean( 0.8 );
// returns NaN
```

```javascript

var round = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/round' );
var mean = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/t/mean' );

var v;
var y;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    v = randu() * 20.0;
    y = mean( v );
    console.log( 'v: %d, E(X,v): %d', v.toFixed( 4 ), y.toFixed( 4 ) );
}
