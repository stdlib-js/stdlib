## Usage

```javascript
var median = require( '@stdlib/stats/base/dists/chisquare/median' );
```

#### median( k )

Returns the [median][median] of a [chi-squared][chisquare-distribution] distribution with degrees of freedom `k`.

```javascript
var v = median( 9.0 );
// returns ~8.343

v = median( 2.0 );
// returns ~1.386
```

If provided `k < 0`, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var y = median( -1.0 );
// returns NaN
```
