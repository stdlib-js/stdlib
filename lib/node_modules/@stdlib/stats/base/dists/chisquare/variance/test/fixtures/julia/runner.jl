	gen( k, name )

Generate fixture data and write to file.

# Arguments

* `x`: input value
* `k`: degrees of freedom
* `name::AbstractString`: output filename

# Examples

``` julia
julia> k = rand( 1000 );
julia> gen( k, \"data.json\" );
```

	z = Array{Float64}( undef, length(k) );

	end

	# Store data to be written to file as a collection:
	data = Dict([
		("k", k),
		("expected", z)
	]);

	# Based on the script directory, create an output filepath:
	filepath = joinpath( dir, name );

	# Write the data to the output filepath as JSON:
	outfile = open( filepath, "w" );
	write( outfile, JSON.json(data) );
	write( outfile, "\n" );
	close( outfile );

# Get the filename:
file = @__FILE__;

# Extract the directory in which this file resides:
dir = dirname( file );

# Generate fixtures:
k = rand( 50 ) .* 20.0;
gen( k, "data.json" );
