// Standard deviation can be used to calculate the measure of the spread of inquiries around the mean:

// => ~1.7321

// Variance can be used to calculate the variability of the number of inquiries:
console.log( poisson.variance( lambda ) );
// => 3

// PMF can be used to calculate specific number of inquiries in an hour:
console.log( poisson.pmf( 4, lambda ) );
// => ~0.1680

// CDF can be used to calculate probability upto certain number of inquiries in an hour:
console.log( poisson.cdf( 2, lambda ) );

// Quantile can be used to calculate the number of inquiries at which you can be 80% confident that the actual number will not exceed.

// MGF can be used for more advanced statistical analyses and generating moments of the distribution.
