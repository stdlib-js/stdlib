{{alias}}()
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a product.

    If provided a value, the accumulator function returns an updated product. If
    not provided a value, the accumulator function returns the current product.

    If provided `NaN` or a value which, when used in computations, results in
    `NaN`, the accumulated value is `NaN` for all future invocations.

    For long running accumulations or accumulations of large numbers, care
    should be taken to prevent overflow. Note, however, that overflow/underflow
    may be transient, as the accumulator does not use a double-precision
    floating-point number to store an accumulated product. Instead, the
    accumulator splits an accumulated product into a normalized fraction and
    exponent and updates each component separately. Doing so guards against a
    loss in precision.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}();
    > var v = accumulator()
    null
    > v = accumulator( 2.0 )
    2.0
    > v = accumulator( -5.0 )
    -10.0
    > v = accumulator()
    -10.0
