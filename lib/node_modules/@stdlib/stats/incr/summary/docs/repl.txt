    The returned summary is an object containing the following fields:

    - count: count.
    - max: maximum value.
    - min: minimum value.
    - range: range.
    - midrange: mid-range.
    - sum: sum.
    - mean: arithmetic mean.
    - variance: unbiased sample variance.
    - stdev: corrected sample standard deviation.
    - skewness: corrected sample skewness.
    - kurtosis: corrected sample excess kurtosis.

    For long running accumulations or accumulations of large numbers, care
    should be taken to prevent overflow.
