{{alias}}( window[, mean] )
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a moving
    unbiased sample variance.

    The `window` parameter defines the number of values over which to compute
    the moving unbiased sample variance.

    If provided a value, the accumulator function returns an updated moving
    unbiased sample variance. If not provided a value, the accumulator function
    returns the current moving unbiased sample variance.

    If provided `NaN` or a value which, when used in computations, results in
    `NaN`, the accumulated value is `NaN` for all future invocations.

    The first `W-1` returned unbiased sample variance values will have less
    statistical support than subsequent unbiased sample variance values, as `W`
    values are needed to fill the window buffer. Until the window is full, the
    returned unbiased sample variance equals the unbiased sample variance of all
    provided values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window: integer
        Window size.

    mean: number (optional)
        Known mean.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}( 3 );
    > var s2 = accumulator()
    null
    > s2 = accumulator( 2.0 )
    0.0
    > s2 = accumulator( -5.0 )
    24.5
    > s2 = accumulator( 3.0 )
    19.0
    > s2 = accumulator( 5.0 )
    28.0
    > s2 = accumulator()
    28.0
