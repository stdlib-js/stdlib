# emptyLike

> Create an uninitialized array having the same length and data type as a provided array.

## Usage

```javascript
var emptyLike = require( '@stdlib/array/empty-like' );
```

#### emptyLike( x\[, dtype] )

Creates an uninitialized array having the same length and [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes] as a provided array `x`.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];

var arr = emptyLike( x );
// returns [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ];
```

By default, the output array [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes] is inferred from the provided array `x`. To return an array having a different [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes], provide a `dtype` argument.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 1 ];

var arr = emptyLike( x, 'int32' );
// returns <Int32Array>
```

## Notes

-   In browser environments, the function always returns zero-filled arrays.
-   If `dtype` is `'generic'`, the function always returns a zero-filled array.
-   In Node.js versions `>=3.0.0`, the underlying memory of returned typed arrays is **not** initialized. Memory contents are unknown and may contain **sensitive** data.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/array/dtypes' );
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/array/zeros' );
var emptyLike = require( '@stdlib/array/empty-like' );

// Create a zero-filled array:
var x = zeros( 4, 'complex128' );

// Get a list of array data types:
var dt = dtypes();

// Generate empty arrays...
var arr;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    arr = emptyLike( x, dt[ i ] );
    console.log( arr );
}
```
