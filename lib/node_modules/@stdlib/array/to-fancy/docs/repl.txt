{{alias}}( x[, options] )
    Converts an array to an object supporting fancy indexing.

    An array supporting fancy indexing is an array which supports slicing via
    indexing expressions for both retrieval and assignment.

    A fancy array shares the *same* data as the provided input array. Hence, any
    mutations to the returned array will affect the underlying input array and
    vice versa.

    For operations returning a new array (e.g., when slicing or invoking an
    instance method), a fancy array returns a new fancy array having the same
    configuration as specified by provided options.

    A fancy array supports indexing using positive and negative integers (both
    numeric literals and strings), Slice instances, and subsequence expressions.

    A fancy array supports all properties and methods of the input array, and,
    thus, a fancy array can be consumed by any API which supports array-like
    objects.

    Indexing expressions provide a convenient and powerful means for creating
    and operating on array views; however, their use does entail a performance
    cost. Indexing expressions are best suited for interactive use (e.g., in the
    REPL) and scripting. For performance critical applications, prefer
    equivalent functional APIs supporting array-like objects.

    Fancy arrays support broadcasting in which assigned scalars and single-
    element arrays are repeated (without additional memory allocation) to match
    the length of a target array instance.

    Fancy array broadcasting follows the same rules as for ndarrays.

    Consequently, when assigning arrays to slices, the array on the right-hand-
    side must be broadcast-compatible with number of elements in the slice.

    Fancy arrays support (mostly) safe casts (i.e., any cast which can be
    performed without overflow or loss of precision, with the exception of
    floating-point arrays which are also allowed to downcast from higher
    precision to lower precision).

    When attempting to perform an unsafe cast, fancy arrays will raise an
    exception.

    When assigning a real-valued scalar to a complex number array (e.g.,
    Complex128Array or Complex64Array), a fancy array will cast the real-valued
    scalar to a complex number argument having an imaginary component equal to
    zero.

    In older JavaScript environments which do not support Proxy objects, the use
    of indexing expressions is not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: Array|TypedArray|Object
        Input array.

    options: Object (optional)
        Function options.

    options.strict: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating whether to enforce strict bounds checking. Default:
        false.

    options.cache: Object (optional)
        Cache for resolving array index objects. Must have a 'get' method which
        accepts a single argument: a string identifier associated with an array
        index. If an array index associated with a provided identifier exists,
        the 'get' method should return an object having the following
        properties:

        - data: the underlying index array.
        - type: the index type. Must be either 'mask', 'bool', or 'int'.
        - dtype: the data type of the underlying array.

        If an array index is not associated with a provided identifier, the
        'get' method should return `null`.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array|TypedArray|Object
        Output array supporting fancy indexing.

    Examples
    --------
    > var y = {{alias}}( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] );
    > y[ '1::2' ]
    [ 2, 4 ]
    > y[ '::-1' ]
    [ 4, 3, 2, 1 ]


{{alias}}.factory( [options] )
    Returns a function for converting an array to an object supporting fancy
    indexing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    options: Object (optional)
        Function options.

    options.strict: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating whether to enforce strict bounds checking by default.
        Default: false.

    options.cache: Object (optional)
        Cache for resolving array index objects. Must have a 'get' method which
        accepts a single argument: a string identifier associated with an array
        index. If an array index associated with a provided identifier exists,
        the 'get' method should return an object having the following
        properties:

        - data: the underlying index array.
        - type: the index type. Must be either 'mask', 'bool', or 'int'.
        - dtype: the data type of the underlying array.

        If an array index is not associated with a provided identifier, the
        'get' method should return `null`.

    Returns
    -------
    fcn: Function
        Function for converting an array to an object supporting fancy indexing.

    Examples
    --------
    > var f = {{alias}}.factory();
    > var y = f( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] );
    > y[ '1::2' ]
    [ 2, 4 ]
    > y[ '::-1' ]
    [ 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
