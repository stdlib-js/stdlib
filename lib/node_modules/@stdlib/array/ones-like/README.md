## Usage

```javascript
var onesLike = require( '@stdlib/array/ones-like' );
```

#### onesLike( x\[, dtype] )

Creates an array filled with ones and having the same length and data type as a provided array `x`.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];

var arr = onesLike( x );
// returns [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ]
```

The function supports the following data types:

-   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `complex128`: double-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `complex64`: single-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `int32`: 32-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint32`: 32-bit unsigned integers
-   `int16`: 16-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint16`: 16-bit unsigned integers
-   `int8`: 8-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint8`: 8-bit unsigned integers
-   `uint8c`: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to `0-255`
-   `generic`: generic JavaScript values

By default, the output array data type is inferred from the provided array `x`. To return an array having a different data type, provide a `dtype` argument.

```javascript
var x = [ 0, 0 ];

var arr = onesLike( x, 'int32' );
// returns <Int32Array>[ 1, 1 ]
```

## Notes

-   If the output array has a complex number data type, each element of the returned array has a real component equal to `1` and an imaginary component equal to `0`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/array/dtypes' );
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/array/zeros' );
var onesLike = require( '@stdlib/array/ones-like' );

// Create a zero-filled array:
var x = zeros( 4, 'complex128' );

// Get a list of array data types:
var dt = dtypes();

// Generate filled arrays...
var y;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    y = onesLike( x, dt[ i ] );
    console.log( y );
}
