{{alias}}( x[, dtype] )
    Returns an array filled with ones and having the same length and data type
    as a provided input array.

    The function supports the following data types:

    - float64: double-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754).
    - float32: single-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754).
    - complex128: double-precision complex floating-point numbers.
    - complex64: single-precision complex floating-point numbers.
    - int32: 32-bit two's complement signed integers.
    - uint32: 32-bit unsigned integers.
    - int16: 16-bit two's complement signed integers.
    - uint16: 16-bit unsigned integers.
    - int8: 8-bit two's complement signed integers.
    - uint8: 8-bit unsigned integers.
    - uint8c: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255.
    - generic: generic JavaScript values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: TypedArray|Array
        Input array.

    dtype: string (optional)
        Data type. If not provided, the output array data type is inferred from
        the input array.

    Returns
    -------
    out: TypedArray|Array
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = new {{alias:@stdlib/array/float64}}( 2 );
    > var y = {{alias}}( x )
    <Float64Array>[ 1.0, 1.0 ]
    > y = {{alias}}( x, 'float32' )
    <Float32Array>[ 1.0, 1.0 ]
