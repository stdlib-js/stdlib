<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var countSameValue = require( '@stdlib/array/base/count-same-value' );
```

#### countSameValue( x, value )

Counts the number of elements in an array that are equal to a specified value.

```javascript
var x = [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 2 ];

var out = countSameValue( x, 1 );
// returns 2
```

In contrast to an implementation using the strict equality operator `===`, the function distinguishes between `+0` and `-0` and treats `NaNs` as the same value.

```javascript
var x = [ NaN, NaN, NaN ];

var out = countSameValue( x, NaN );
// returns 3
```

## Notes

-   The function uses the [SameValue Algorithm][@stdlib/assert/is-same-value] as specified in ECMAScript 5.
