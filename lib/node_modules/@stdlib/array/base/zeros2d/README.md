## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var gfill = require( '@stdlib/blas/ext/base/gfill' );
var zeros2d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros2d' );

// Create a zero-filled array:
var arr = zeros2d( [ 5, 10 ] );

// Fill nested arrays with the same value...
gfill( arr[ 0 ].length, 1.0, arr[ 0 ], 1 );
gfill( arr[ 1 ].length, 2.0, arr[ 1 ], 1 );
gfill( arr[ 2 ].length, 3.0, arr[ 2 ], 1 );
gfill( arr[ 3 ].length, 4.0, arr[ 3 ], 1 );
gfill( arr[ 4 ].length, 5.0, arr[ 4 ], 1 );

console.log( arr );
// => [ [ 1.0, 1.0, ... ], [ 2.0, 2.0, ... ], [ 3.0, 3.0, ... ], [ 4.0, 4.0, ... ], [ 5.0, 5.0, ... ] ]
