# linspace

> Generate a linearly spaced numeric array.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var linspace = require( '@stdlib/array/base/linspace' );
```

#### linspace( start, stop, length )

Generates a linearly spaced numeric `array`.

```javascript
var arr = linspace( 0, 100, 6 );
// returns [ 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 ]
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The function assumes that `length` is greater than or equal to `2`.

-   The output `array` is guaranteed to include the `start` and `stop` values. Beware, however, that values between `start` and `stop` are subject to floating-point rounding errors. Hence,

    ```javascript
    var arr = linspace( 0, 1, 3 );
    // returns [ 0, ~0.5, 1 ]
    ```

    where `arr[1]` is only guaranteed to be approximately equal to `0.5`. If you desire more control over element precision, consider using [`roundn`][@stdlib/math/base/special/roundn]:

    ```javascript
    var roundn = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/roundn' );

    // Create an array subject to floating-point rounding errors:
    var arr = linspace( 0, 1, 21 );

    // Round each value to the nearest hundredth:
    var i;
    for ( i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
        arr[ i ] = roundn( arr[ i ], -2 );
    }
    console.log( arr.join( '\n' ) );
    ```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var linspace = require( '@stdlib/array/base/linspace' );

// Create arrays of varying lengths:
var out = linspace( 0, 10, 10 );
console.log( out );

out = linspace( 0, 10, 11 );
console.log( out );

out = linspace( 0, 10, 21 );
console.log( out );

// Create an array with decremented values:
out = linspace( 10, 0, 11 );
console.log( out );
```
