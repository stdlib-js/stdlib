## Usage

```javascript
var bbinary3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/broadcasted-binary3d' );
```

#### bbinary3d( arrays, shapes, fcn )

Applies a binary callback to elements in two [broadcasted][@stdlib/array/base/broadcast-array] nested input arrays and assigns results to elements in a three-dimensional nested output array.

```javascript
var zeros3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros3d' );
var add = require( '@stdlib/math/base/ops/add' );

var x = [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ] ];
var y = [ [ 3.0 ], [ 4.0 ] ];
var z = zeros3d( [ 2, 2, 2 ] );

var shapes = [
    [ 1, 2 ],
    [ 2, 1 ],
    [ 2, 2, 2 ]
];

bbinary3d( [ x, y, z ], shapes, add );
// z => [ [ [ 4.0, 5.0 ], [ 5.0, 6.0 ] ], [ [ 4.0, 5.0 ], [ 5.0, 6.0 ] ] ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **arrays**: array-like object containing two input nested arrays and one output nested array.
-   **shapes**: array shapes.
-   **fcn**: binary function to apply.

## Notes

-   The input and output array shapes must be broadcast [compatible][@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-shapes].

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/base/discrete-uniform' ).factory;
var filled3dBy = require( '@stdlib/array/base/filled3d-by' );
var zeros3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros3d' );
var add = require( '@stdlib/math/base/ops/add' );
var bbinary3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/broadcasted-binary3d' );

var shapes = [
    [ 1, 1, 3 ],
    [ 3, 1, 1 ],
    [ 3, 3, 3 ]
];

var x = filled3dBy( shapes[ 0 ], discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( x );

var y = filled3dBy( shapes[ 1 ], discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( y );

var z = zeros3d( shapes[ 2 ] );
console.log( z );

bbinary3d( [ x, y, z ], shapes, add );
console.log( z );
```
