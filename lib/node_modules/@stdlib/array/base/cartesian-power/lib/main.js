// MAIN //

/**
* Returns the Cartesian power.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   The Cartesian power is an n-fold Cartesian product involving a single array. The main insight of this implementation is that the n-fold Cartesian product can be presented as an n-dimensional array stored in row-major order. As such, we can
*
*     -   Compute the total number of tuples, which is simply the size of the provided array (set) raised to the specified power `n`. For n-dimensional arrays, this is the equivalent of computing the product of array dimensions to determine the total number of elements.
*     -   Initialize an array for storing indices for indexing into the provided array. For n-dimensional arrays, the index array is equivalent to an array of subscripts for indexing into each dimension.
*     -   For the outermost loop, treat the loop index as a linear index into an n-dimensional array and resolve the corresponding subscripts.
*     -   Continue iterating until all tuples have been generated.
*
* @param {ArrayLikeObject} x - input array
* @param {NonNegativeInteger} n - power
* @returns {Array<Array>} list of ordered tuples comprising the Cartesian product
*
* @example
* var x = [ 1, 2 ];
*
* var out = cartesianPower( x, 2 );
* // returns [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 1 ], [ 2, 2 ] ]
