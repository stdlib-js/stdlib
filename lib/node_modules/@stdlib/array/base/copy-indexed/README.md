## Usage

```javascript
var copyIndexed = require( '@stdlib/array/base/copy-indexed' );
```

#### copyIndexed( x )

Copies the elements of an indexed array-like object to a new "generic" array.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

var out = copyIndexed( x );
// returns [ 1, 2, 3  ]

var bool = ( out === x );
// returns false
```

## Notes

-   An _indexed_ array-like object is a data structure in which one retrieves elements via integer indices using bracket `[]` notation (e.g., `Float64Array`, `Int32Array`, `Array`, etc). This is in contrast to an _accessor_ array-like object in which one retrieves elements using `get` and `set` methods (e.g., `Complex64Array` and `Complex128Array`).

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var filledBy = require( '@stdlib/array/filled-by' );
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/base/randu' );
var copyIndexed = require( '@stdlib/array/base/copy-indexed' );

// Create a Float64Array:
var arr = filledBy( 10, 'float64', randu );

// Copy elements to a generic array:
var out = copyIndexed( arr );

// Retrieve the first element:
var x = out[ 0 ];
// returns <number>

console.log( '%d', x );
```
