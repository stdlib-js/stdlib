## Usage

```javascript
var countSameValueZero = require( '@stdlib/array/base/count-same-value-zero' );
```

#### countSameValueZero( x, value )

Counts the number of elements in an array that are equal to a specified value.

```javascript
var x = [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 2 ];

var out = countSameValueZero( x, 1 );
// returns 2
```

In contrast to an implementation using the strict equality operator `===`, the function treats `NaNs` as the same value.

```javascript
var x = [ NaN, NaN, NaN ];

var out = countSameValueZero( x, NaN );
// returns 3
```

In contrast to an implementation using the [SameValue Algorithm][@stdlib/array/base/count-same-value] (as specified in ECMAScript 5), the function does not distinguish between `+0` and `-0`.

```javascript
var x = [ 0.0, -0.0, 0.0 ];

var out = countSameValueZero( x, 0.0 );
// returns 3
```
