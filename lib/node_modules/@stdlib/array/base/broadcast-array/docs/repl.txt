{{alias}}( x, inShape, outShape )
    Broadcasts an array to a specified shape.

    The broadcasted array shares the same data as the input array. As more than
    one element of a broadcasted array may refer to the same memory location,
    writing to the broadcasted array may affect multiple elements. If you need
    to write to the broadcasted array, copy the array before performing
    operations which may mutate elements.

    The function throws an error if a provided input shape is incompatible with
    a provided output shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: Collection
        Input array.

    inShape: Collection<number>
        Input array shape.

    outShape: Collection<number>
        Output array shape.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Object
        Broadcast object.

    out.ref: Collection
        Reference to original input array.

    out.data: ArrayLikeObject
        Broadcasted array.

    out.shape: Array<number>
        Broadcasted array shape.

    out.strides: Array<number>
        Broadcasted array strides.

    Examples
    --------
    > var out = {{alias}}( [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 3 ], [ 2, 3 ] )
    {...}
    > out.shape
    [ 2, 3 ]
    > out.strides
    [ 0, 1 ]
    > out.data
    [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]
