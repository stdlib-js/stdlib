## Usage

```javascript
var ctors = require( '@stdlib/array/ctors' );
```

#### ctors( dtype )

Returns an array constructor for a specified data type.

```javascript
var ctor = ctors( 'float64' );
// returns <Function>
```

The function returns constructors for the following data types:

-   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers.
-   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers.
-   `generic`: values of any type.
-   `int16`: signed 16-bit integers.
-   `int32`: signed 32-bit integers.
-   `int8`: signed 8-bit integers.
-   `uint16`: unsigned 16-bit integers.
-   `uint32`: unsigned 32-bit integers.
-   `uint8`: unsigned 8-bit integers.
-   `uint8c`: unsigned clamped 8-bit integers.

If provided an unknown or unsupported data type, the function returns `null`.

```javascript
var ctor = ctors( 'float' );
// returns null
```
