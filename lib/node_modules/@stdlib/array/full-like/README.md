## Usage

```javascript
var fullLike = require( '@stdlib/array/full-like' );
```

#### fullLike( x, value\[, dtype] )

Creates a filled array having the same length and [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes] as a provided array `x`.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];

var arr = fullLike( x, 1 );
// returns [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ]
```

By default, the output array [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes] is inferred from the provided array `x`. To return an array having a different [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes], provide a `dtype` argument.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 1 ];

var arr = fullLike( x, 1, 'int32' );
// returns <Int32Array>[ 1, 1 ]
```

## Notes

-   If provided a number and the output array [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes] is a complex number [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes], the function returns a complex number array where each element has a real component whose value equals the provided fill value and where each element has an imaginary component equal to `0`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/array/dtypes' );
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/array/zeros' );
var fullLike = require( '@stdlib/array/full-like' );

// Create a zero-filled array:
var x = zeros( 4, 'complex128' );

// Get a list of array data types:
var dt = dtypes();

// Generate filled arrays...
var y;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    y = fullLike( x, 1.0, dt[ i ] );
    console.log( y );
}
```
