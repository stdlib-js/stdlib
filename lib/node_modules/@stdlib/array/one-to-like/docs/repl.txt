{{alias}}( x[, dtype] )
    Generates a linearly spaced numeric array whose elements increment by 1
    starting from one and having the same length and data type as a provided
    input array.

    The function supports the following data types:

    - float64: double-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
    - float32: single-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
    - complex128: double-precision complex floating-point numbers
    - complex64: single-precision complex floating-point numbers
    - int32: 32-bit two's complement signed integers
    - uint32: 32-bit unsigned integers
    - int16: 16-bit two's complement signed integers
    - uint16: 16-bit unsigned integers
    - int8: 8-bit two's complement signed integers
    - uint8: 8-bit unsigned integers
    - uint8c: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255
    - generic: generic JavaScript values

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: TypedArray|Array
        Input array.

    dtype: string (optional)
        Data type. If not provided, the output array data type is inferred from
        the input array.

    Returns
    -------
    out: TypedArray|Array
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var arr = {{alias}}( [ 0, 0 ] )
    [ 1, 2 ]
    > arr = {{alias}}( [ 0, 0 ], 'float32' )
    <Float32Array>[ 1.0, 2.0 ]
