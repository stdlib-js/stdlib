## Usage

```javascript
var nans = require( '@stdlib/array/nans' );
```

#### nans( length\[, dtype] )

Creates an array filled with NaNs and having a specified length.

```javascript
var arr = nans( 2 );
// returns <Float64Array>[ NaN, NaN ]
```

The function recognizes the following data types:

-   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `complex128`: double-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `complex64`: single-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `generic`: generic JavaScript values

By default, the output array data type is `float64` (i.e., a [typed array][mdn-typed-array]). To specify an alternative data type, provide a `dtype` argument.

```javascript
var arr = nans( 2, 'float32' );
// returns <Float32Array>[ NaN, NaN ]
```

## Notes

-   For complex number arrays, each element of the returned array has a real component equal to `NaN` and an imaginary component equal to `NaN`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/array/typed-float-dtypes' );
var nans = require( '@stdlib/array/nans' );

// Get a list of array data types:
var dt = dtypes();

// Generate filled arrays...
var arr;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    arr = nans( 4, dt[ i ] );
    console.log( arr );
}
