{{alias}}( x, y )
    Converts an input array to the same data type as a second input array.

    The function supports input arrays having the following data types:

    - float32: single-precision floating-point numbers.
    - float64: double-precision floating-point numbers.
    - complex64: single-precision complex floating-point numbers.
    - complex128: double-precision complex floating-point numbers.
    - generic: values of any type.
    - int16: signed 16-bit integers.
    - int32: signed 32-bit integers.
    - int8: signed 8-bit integers.
    - uint16: unsigned 16-bit integers.
    - uint32: unsigned 32-bit integers.
    - uint8: unsigned 8-bit integers.
    - uint8c: unsigned clamped 8-bit integers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ArrayLikeObject
        Array to convert.

    y: Array|TypedArray
        Array having desired output data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array|TypedArray
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ];
    > var y = new {{alias:@stdlib/array/float32}}( 0 );
    > var out = {{alias}}( x, y )
    <Float32Array>[ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ]
