## Usage

```javascript
var ones = require( '@stdlib/array/ones' );
```

#### ones( length\[, dtype] )

Creates an array filled with ones and having a specified length.

```javascript
var arr = ones( 2 );
// returns <Float64Array>[ 1.0, 1.0 ]
```

The function recognizes the following data types:

-   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `complex128`: double-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `complex64`: single-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `int32`: 32-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint32`: 32-bit unsigned integers
-   `int16`: 16-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint16`: 16-bit unsigned integers
-   `int8`: 8-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint8`: 8-bit unsigned integers
-   `uint8c`: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to `0-255`
-   `generic`: generic JavaScript values

By default, the output array data type is `float64` (i.e., a [typed array][mdn-typed-array]). To specify an alternative data type, provide a `dtype` argument.

```javascript
var arr = ones( 2, 'int32' );
// returns <Int32Array>[ 1, 1 ]
```

## Notes

-   For complex number arrays, each entry of the returned array has a real component equal to `1` and an imaginary component equal to `0`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/array/dtypes' );
var ones = require( '@stdlib/array/ones' );

// Get a list of array data types:
var dt = dtypes();

// Generate filled arrays...
var arr;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    arr = ones( 4, dt[ i ] );
    console.log( arr );
}
