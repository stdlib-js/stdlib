## Usage

```javascript
var zeroToLike = require( '@stdlib/array/zero-to-like' );
```

#### zeroToLike( x\[, dtype] )

Generates a linearly spaced numeric array whose elements increment by `1` starting from zero and having the same length and data type as a provided input array `x`.

```javascript
var arr = zeroToLike( [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ] );
// returns [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

The function recognizes the following data types:

-   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `complex128`: double-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `complex64`: single-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `int32`: 32-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint32`: 32-bit unsigned integers
-   `int16`: 16-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint16`: 16-bit unsigned integers
-   `int8`: 8-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint8`: 8-bit unsigned integers
-   `uint8c`: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to `0-255`
-   `generic`: generic JavaScript values

By default, the output array data type is inferred from the provided array `x`. To return an array having a different data type, provide a `dtype` argument.

```javascript
var arr = zeroToLike( [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ], 'int32' );
// returns <Int32Array>[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

## Notes

-   For complex number arrays, each element of the returned array has an imaginary component equal to `0`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var sort2hp = require( '@stdlib/blas/ext/base/gsort2hp' );
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/discrete-uniform' );
var zeroToLike = require( '@stdlib/array/zero-to-like' );

// Generate an array of random numbers:
var opts = {
    'dtype': 'generic'
};
var x = discreteUniform( 10, 100, 200, opts );

// Generate an array of indices:
var idx = zeroToLike( x );

// Create a temporary array to avoid mutation:
var tmp = x.slice();

// Sort the index array according to the sort order of `x`:
sort2hp( x.length, 1, tmp, 1, idx, 1 );

console.log( x );
console.log( idx );
```
