{{alias}}( [kind] )
    Returns a list of array data types.

    When not provided a data type "kind", the function returns an array
    containing the following data types:

    - float32: single-precision floating-point numbers.
    - float64: double-precision floating-point numbers.
    - complex64: single-precision complex floating-point numbers.
    - complex128: double-precision complex floating-point numbers.
    - generic: values of any type.
    - int16: signed 16-bit integers.
    - int32: signed 32-bit integers.
    - int8: signed 8-bit integers.
    - uint16: unsigned 16-bit integers.
    - uint32: unsigned 32-bit integers.
    - uint8: unsigned 8-bit integers.
    - uint8c: unsigned clamped 8-bit integers.

    The function supports the following data type "kinds":

    - floating_point: floating-point data types.
    - real_floating_point: real-valued floating-point data types.
    - complex_floating_point: complex-valued floating-point data types.
    - integer: integer data types.
    - signed_integer: signed integer data types.
    - unsigned_integer: unsigned integer data types.
    - real: real-valued data types.
    - numeric: numeric data types.
    - all: all data types.

    Parameters

    kind: string (optional)
        Data type kind.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<string>
        List of array data types.

    Examples
    --------
    > var out = {{alias}}()
    <Array>
