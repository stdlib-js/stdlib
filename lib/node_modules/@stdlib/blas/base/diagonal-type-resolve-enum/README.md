## Usage

```javascript
var resolve = require( '@stdlib/blas/base/diagonal-type-resolve-enum' );
```

#### resolve( value )

Returns the enumeration constant associated with a BLAS diagonal type value.

```javascript
var str2enum = require( '@stdlib/blas/base/diagonal-type-str2enum' );

var v = resolve( 'non-unit' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( str2enum( 'non-unit' ) );
// returns <number>
```

If unable to resolve an enumeration constant, the function returns `null`.

```javascript
var v = resolve( 'beep' );
// returns null
```

## Notes

-   Downstream consumers of this function should **not** rely on specific integer values (e.g., `UNIT == 0`). Instead, the function should be used in an opaque manner.
