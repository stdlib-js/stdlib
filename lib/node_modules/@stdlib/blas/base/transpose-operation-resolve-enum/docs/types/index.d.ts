* ## Notes
*
* -   Downstream consumers of this function should **not** rely on specific integer values (e.g., `TRANSPOSE == 0`). Instead, the function should be used in an opaque manner.
*
* @param operation - operation value
* @returns enumeration constant
*
* @example
* var v = resolve( 'conjugate-transpose' );
* // returns <number>
