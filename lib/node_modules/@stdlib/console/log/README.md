## Usage

```javascript
var log = require( '@stdlib/console/log' );
```

#### log( \[data]\[,..args] )

Outputs a message to the debugger console.

```javascript
log( 'Hello, World!' );
```

If the first argument is a string, the argument is the primary message and may include zero or more substitution strings.

```javascript
log( 'Hello, %s!', 'World' );
```

## Notes

-   In general, prefer formatting with [`@stdlib/string/format`][@stdlib/string/format], as string substitution support is not consistent across JavaScript environments.

    ```javascript
    var format = require( '@stdlib/string/format' );

    log( format( '%s: %.2f', 'Foo', 3.14 ) );
    ```
