# Architecture

> Operating system CPU architecture for which the JavaScript runtime binary was compiled.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var ARCH = require( '@stdlib/os/arch' );
```

#### ARCH

Operating system CPU architecture for which the JavaScript runtime binary was compiled.

```javascript
console.log( ARCH );
// => <string>
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   In general, the target build architecture of the JavaScript runtime binary should match the host architecture; however, this is **not** guaranteed to always be true (e.g., if attempting to run an x64 build of Node.js on an arm64 host machine).

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var ARCH = require( '@stdlib/os/arch' );

if ( ARCH === 'arm' || ARCH === 'arm64' ) {
    console.log( 'Running on ARM...' );
} else {
    console.log( 'Running on something else...' );
}
