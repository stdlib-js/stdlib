## Usage

```javascript
var replaceAfter = require( '@stdlib/string/base/replace-after' );
```

#### replaceAfter( str, replacement, search\[, fromIndex] )

Replaces the substring after the first occurrence of a specified search string.

```javascript
var str = 'beep boop';
var replacement = 'foo';
var out = replaceAfter( str, replacement, 'o' );
// returns 'beep bofoo'

out = replaceAfter( str, replacement, ' ' );
// returns 'beep foo'
```

By default, the search starts at the beginning of the string. To start searching from a different index, provide a `fromIndex` argument:

```javascript
var str = 'boop baz boop';
var replacement = 'foo';
var out = replaceAfter( str, replacement, 'o', 3 );
// returns 'boop baz bofoo'
```

## Notes

-   If a substring is not present in a provided string, the function returns an empty string.
-   If provided an empty substring, the function returns the input string.
-   If `fromIndex` is less than `0` or greater than `str.length`, the search starts at index `0` and `str.length`, respectively.
