## Usage

```javascript
var forEachCodePointRight = require( '@stdlib/string/base/for-each-code-point-right' );
```

#### forEachCodePointRight( str, clbk\[, thisArg ] )

Invokes a function for each Unicode code point in a string, iterating from right to left.

```javascript
function log( value, index ) {
    console.log( '%d: %s', index, value );
}

forEachCodePointRight( 'Beep!', log );
/* =>
    4: !
    3: p
    2: e
    1: e
    0: B
*/
```

The invoked function is provided three arguments:

-   **value**: Unicode code point.
-   **index**: starting Unicode code point index.
-   **str**: input string.

To set the function execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function clbk() {
    this.count += 1;
}

var str = 'üëâüèø';

var ctx = {
    'count': 0
};

forEachCodePointRight( str, clbk, ctx );

var cnt = ctx.count;
// returns 2
```
