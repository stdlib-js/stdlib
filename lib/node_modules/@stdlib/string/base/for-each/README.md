## Usage

```javascript
var forEach = require( '@stdlib/string/base/for-each' );
```

#### forEach( str, clbk\[, thisArg ] )

Invokes a function for each UTF-16 code unit in a string.

```javascript
function log( value, index ) {
    console.log( '%d: %s', index, value );
}

forEach( 'Beep!', log );
/* =>
    0: B
    1: e
    2: e
    3: p
    4: !
*/
```

The invoked function is provided three arguments:

-   **value**: character.
-   **index**: character index.
-   **str**: input string.

To set the function execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function clbk() {
    this.count += 1;
}

var str = 'üëâüèø';

var ctx = {
    'count': 0
};

forEach( str, clbk, ctx );

var cnt = ctx.count;
// returns 4
```
