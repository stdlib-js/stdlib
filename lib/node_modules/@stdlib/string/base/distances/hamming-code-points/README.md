# hammingCodePointsDistance

> Calculate the [Hamming code points distance][hamming-distance] between two equal-length unicode code points.

<!-- Package usage documentation. -->

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var hammingCodePointsDistance = require( '@stdlib/string/base/distances/hamming-code-points' );
```

#### hammingCodePointsDistance( s1, s2 )

Calculate the [Hamming code points distance][hamming-distance] between two equal-length unicode code points.

```javascript
var dist = hammingCodePointsDistance( 'Hello, world!', 'Héllö, wörld!' );
// returns 3

dist = hammingCodePointsDistance( 'a😊c', 'a😃c' );
// returns 1

dist = hammingCodePointsDistance( 'नमस्ते', 'नमस्का' );
// returns 2

dist = hammingCodePointsDistance( '你好', '世界' );
// returns 2

dist = hammingCodePointsDistance( 'こんにちは', 'さようなら' );
// returns 5
```

## Notes

-   If the two strings differ in length, the [Hamming code points distance][hamming-distance] is not defined. Consequently, when provided two input strings of unequal length, the function returns a sentinel value of `-1`.  
-   As the function calculates the [Hamming code points distance][hamming-distance] by comparing UTF-16 code units, the function should behave as expected for strings composed of all unicode charracters.
