# hammingGraphemeClusters

> Calculate the [Hamming distance][hamming-distance] between two strings, treating grapheme clusters as the unit of comparison

<!-- Package usage documentation. -->

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var hammingGraphemeClusters = require( '@stdlib/string/base/distances/hamming-grapheme-clusters' );
```

#### hammingGraphemeClusters( s1, s2 )

Calculates the [Hamming distance][hamming-distance] between two strings, treating [grapheme clusters][grapheme-cluster] (as opposed to characters) as a single unit

```javascript
var dist = hammingGraphemeClusters( 'café', 'cafe' );
// returns 1

dist = hammingGraphemeClusters( '🍕🍕🍕', '❤🍕🍕' );
// returns 1

dist = hammingGraphemeClusters( 'tooth', 'froth' );
// returns 2

dist = hammingGraphemeClusters( '', '' );
// returns 0

dist = hammingGraphemeClusters( 'Später', 'Spæter' );
// returns 1
```

## Notes

-   If the two strings differ in length, the [Hamming distance][hamming-distance] is not defined. Consequently, when provided two input strings of unequal number of grapheme units, the function returns a sentinel value of `-1`.  
-   As the function calculates the [Hamming distance][hamming-distance] by comparing grapheme clusters, when the character(s) are composed of multiple Unicode code points, it will treat the difference between the characters as a unit difference.

dist = hammingGraphemeClusters( 'elephant', 'Tashkent' );
// returns 6

dist = hammingGraphemeClusters( 'Résumé', 'Resume' );
// returns 2

dist = hammingGraphemeClusters( '', '' );
