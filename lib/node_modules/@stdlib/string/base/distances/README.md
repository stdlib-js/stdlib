<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var distances = require( '@stdlib/string/base/distances' );
```

#### distances

Namespace containing "distances", i.e, implementations of various string similarity metrics.

```javascript
var ns = distances;
// returns {...}
```

The namespace contains the following functions:

<div class="namespace-toc">

-   <span class="signature">[`levenshteinDistance( s1, s2 )`][@stdlib/string/base/distances/levenshtein]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">calculates the Levenshtein (edit) distance between two strings.</span>
