## Usage

```javascript
var fromCodePoint = require( '@stdlib/string/from-code-point' );
```

#### fromCodePoint( pt1\[, pt2\[, pt3\[, ...]]] )

Creates a `string` from a sequence of Unicode [code points][code-point].

```javascript
var out = fromCodePoint( 9731 );
// returns '☃'
```

In addition to providing [code points][code-point] as separate arguments, the function supports providing an array-like `object` as a single argument containing a sequence of [code points][code-point].

```javascript
var Uint16Array = require( '@stdlib/array/uint16' );

var out = fromCodePoint( 97, 98, 99 );
// returns 'abc'

out = fromCodePoint( new Uint16Array( [ 97, 98, 99 ] ) );
// returns 'abc'
```

## Notes

-   This function differs from [`String.fromCharCode`][mdn-string-fromcharcode] in the following ways:

    -   The function provides support for all valid Unicode values (up to `21` bits). While most common Unicode values can be represented using one 16-bit unit, higher code point characters require two 16-bit units (a surrogate pair consisting of a high and a low surrogate) to form a single character. [`String.fromCharCode`][mdn-string-fromcharcode] does **not** support surrogate pairs, supporting only UCS-2, a subset of [UTF-16][utf-16].

-   This function differs from [`String.fromCodePoint`][mdn-string-fromcodepoint] in the following ways:

    -   The function supports explicitly providing an array-like `object` containing a sequence of [code points][code-point].
    -   The function requires **at least** one [code point][code-point].
    -   The function requires that all [code points][code-point] be nonnegative integers. The function does **not** support values, such as `null`, `undefined`, `true`, `false`, `'0'`, `'1'`, etc., which can be cast to integer values.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/base/randu' );
var floor = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/floor' );
var UNICODE_MAX_BMP = require( '@stdlib/constants/unicode/max-bmp' );
var fromCodePoint = require( '@stdlib/string/from-code-point' );

var x;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    x = floor( randu()*UNICODE_MAX_BMP );
    console.log( '%d => %s', x, fromCodePoint( x ) );

### Usage

```text
Usage: from-code-point [options] [<code_point> <code_point> ...]

Options:

  -h,    --help                Print this message.
  -V,    --version             Print the package version.
         --split sep           Delimiter for stdin data. Default: '/\\r?\\n/'.
```

<section class="notes">

### Notes

-   If the split separator is a [regular expression][mdn-regexp], ensure that the `split` option is either properly escaped or enclosed in quotes.

    ```bash
    # Not escaped...
    $ echo -n $'97\n98\n99' | from-code-point --split /\r?\n/

    # Escaped...
    $ echo -n $'97\n98\n99' | from-code-point --split /\\r?\\n/
    ```

-   The implementation ignores trailing delimiters.

<section class="examples">

### Examples

```bash
$ from-code-point 9731
☃
```

To use as a [standard stream][standard-streams],

```bash
$ echo -n '9731' | from-code-point
☃
```

By default, when used as a [standard stream][standard-streams], the implementation assumes newline-delimited data. To specify an alternative delimiter, set the `split` option.

```bash
$ echo -n '97\t98\t99\t' | from-code-point --split '\t'
abc
```
