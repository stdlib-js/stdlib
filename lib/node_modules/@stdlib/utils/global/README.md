## Usage

```javascript
var getGlobal = require( '@stdlib/utils/global' );
```

#### getGlobal( \[codegen] )

Returns the global object.

```javascript
var g = getGlobal();
// returns {...}
```

By default, the function does **not** use code generation when resolving the global object. While code generation is the **most** reliable means for resolving the global object, its use may violate [content security policies][mdn-csp] (CSPs). To use code generation, provide a `codegen` argument equal to `true`.

```javascript
var g = getGlobal( true );
// returns {...}
```
