# nextTick

> Add a callback to the "next tick queue".

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var nextTick = require( '@stdlib/utils/next-tick' );
```

#### nextTick( clbk\[, ...args] )

Adds a callback to the "next tick queue".

```javascript
function beep() {
    console.log( 'boop' );
}

nextTick( beep );
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The queue is fully drained after the current operation on the JavaScript stack runs to completion and before the event loop is allowed to continue.
-   Creating an infinite loop is possible if `nextTick` is called recursively.
