## Notes

* The first element is the absolute pathname of the executable that started the calling process.
* The second element is the path of the executed file.
* Any additional elements are additional command-line arguments.
* Modifications to `ARGV` are local to the process in which `ARGV` is modified.
* Be careful when modifying command-line arguments as the argument array represents shared state. Accordingly, modifications affect all command-line argument consumers.
