{{alias}}( arr, initial, reducer[, thisArg] )
    Reduces the number of dimensions by one of a two-dimensional nested array by
    applying a function against an accumulator and each element along the
    innermost dimension and returning the accumulation results as a one-
    dimensional array.

    The applied function is provided the following arguments:

    - accumulator: accumulated value.
    - value: array element.
    - i: index of the first dimension.
    - j: index of the second dimension.
    - arr: input array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ArrayLikeObject<ArrayLikeObject>
        Input array of arrays.

    initial: ArrayLikeObject
        Initial values. Must have a length equal to the size of the outermost
        input array dimension.

    reducer: Function
        Function to apply.

    thisArg: any (optional)
        Input function context.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array
        Accumulation results.

    Examples
    --------
    > var f = {{alias:@stdlib/utils/nary-function}}( {{alias:@stdlib/math/base/ops/add}}, 2 );
    > var arr = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ] ];
    > var out = {{alias}}( arr, [ 0, 0 ], f )
    [ 6, 15 ]
