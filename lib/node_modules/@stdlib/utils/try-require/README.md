## Usage

```javascript
var tryRequire = require( '@stdlib/utils/try-require' );
```

#### tryRequire( id )

Wraps `require` in a `try/catch` block. If able to resolve a module `id`, the function returns the value bound to `module.exports` in the resolved module. Otherwise, the function returns an `Error`.

```javascript
var x = tryRequire( 'beep' );

if ( x instanceof Error ) {
    console.log( x.message );
}
```

## Notes

-   Use caution when attempting to resolve a relative path or a local module. This function attempts to resolve a module from its current path. Thus, the function is **unable** to resolve anything which is not along its search path. For local requires, use an absolute file path.

    ```javascript
    var resolve = require( 'path' ).resolve;

    var out = tryRequire( resolve( '/foo/bar/baz', '..', 'lib', 'beep.js' ) );

    if ( out instanceof Error ) {
        console.error( out.message );
    }
    ```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var tryRequire = require( '@stdlib/utils/try-require' );

var out = tryRequire( '_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789_' );
if ( out instanceof Error ) {
    console.error( out.message );
} else {
    throw new Error( 'expected an error' );
}

out = tryRequire( '@stdlib/utils/try-require' );
if ( out !== tryRequire ) {
    throw new Error( 'expected export' );
}
