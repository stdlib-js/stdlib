{{alias}}( dtype )
    Returns the size (in bytes) of the canonical binary representation of a
    specified numeric type.

    The following numeric types are supported:

    - float64: double-precision floating-point numbers.
    - float32: single-precision floating-point numbers.
    - float16: half-precision floating-point numbers.
    - int32: 32-bit two's complement signed integers.
    - uint32: 32-bit unsigned integers.
    - int16: 16-bit two's complement signed integers.
    - uint16: 16-bit unsigned integers.
    - int8: 8-bit two's complement signed integers.
    - uint8: 8-bit unsigned integers.
    - uint8c: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255.
    - complex128: 128-bit complex numbers.
    - complex64: 64-bit complex numbers.

    ----------
    dtype: string
        Numeric type.

    Returns
