{{alias}}( dtype )
    Returns the size (in bytes) of the canonical binary representation of a
    specified numeric type.

    The following numeric types are supported:

    - float64: double-precision floating-point numbers
    - float32: single-precision floating-point numbers
    - float16: half-precision floating-point numbers
    - int32: 32-bit two's complement signed integers
    - uint32: 32-bit unsigned integers
    - int16: 16-bit two's complement signed integers
    - uint16: 16-bit unsigned integers
    - int8: 8-bit two's complement signed integers
    - uint8: 8-bit unsigned integers
    - uint8c: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255
    - complex128: 128-bit complex numbers
    - complex64: 64-bit complex numbers

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype: string
        Numeric type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: number
        Size (in bytes).

    Examples
    --------
    > var s = {{alias}}( 'int8' )
    1
    > s = {{alias}}( 'uint32' )
