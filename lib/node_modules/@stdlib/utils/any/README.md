## Usage

```javascript
var any = require( '@stdlib/utils/any' );
```

#### any( collection )

Tests whether at least one element in a `collection` is truthy.

```javascript
var arr = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 ];

var bool = any( arr );
// returns true
```

If provided an empty `collection`, the function returns `false`.

```javascript
var bool = any( [] );
// returns false
```

## Notes

-   A `collection` may be either an [`Array`][mdn-array], [`Typed Array`][mdn-typed-array], or an array-like [`Object`][mdn-object] (excluding `strings` and `functions`).
-   The function does **not** skip `undefined` elements and is thus not optimized for sparse collections.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/base/randu' );
var any = require( '@stdlib/utils/any' );

var bool;
var arr;
var i;

arr = [];
for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    arr.push( ( randu() > 0.95 ) );
}

bool = any( arr );
// returns <boolean>
```
