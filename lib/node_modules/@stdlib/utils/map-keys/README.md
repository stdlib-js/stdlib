## Usage

```javascript
var mapKeys = require( '@stdlib/utils/map-keys' );
```

#### mapKeys( obj, transform )

Map keys from one `object` to a new `object` having the same values.

```javascript
function transform( key, value ) {
    return key + value;
}

var obj1 = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2
};

var obj2 = mapKeys( obj1, transform );
// returns { 'a1': 1, 'b2': 2 }
```

The `transform` function is provided three arguments:

-   `key`: object key
-   `value`: object value corresponding to `key`
-   `obj`: the input object

## Notes

-   Key iteration order is **not** guaranteed, as `object` key enumeration is not specified according to the [ECMAScript specification][ecma-262-for-in]. In practice, however, most engines use insertion order to sort an `object`'s keys, thus allowing for deterministic return values.
-   The function only maps **own** properties. Hence, the function does **not** map inherited properties.
-   The function **shallow** copies key values.
-   The value returned by a `transform` function should be a value which can be serialized as an `object` key.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var mapKeys = require( '@stdlib/utils/map-keys' );

function transform( key, value ) {
    return key + ':' + value;
}

var obj1 = {
    'a': 'beep',
    'b': 'boop',
    'c': 'foo',
    'd': 'bar'
};

var obj2 = mapKeys( obj1, transform );

console.dir( obj2 );
// => { 'a:beep': 'beep', 'b:boop': 'boop', 'c:foo': 'foo', 'd:bar': 'bar' }
```
