{{alias}}( value[, level] )
    Returns an array of an object's inherited writable property names.

    Name order is not guaranteed, as object key enumeration is not specified
    according to the ECMAScript specification. In practice, however, most
    engines use insertion order to sort an object's keys, thus allowing for
    deterministic extraction.

    If provided `null` or `undefined`, the function returns an empty array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value: any
        Input value.

    level: integer (optional)
        Inheritance level.

    Returns
    -------
    keys: Array
        List of an object's inherited writable property names.

    Examples
    --------
    > var keys = {{alias}}( {} )
