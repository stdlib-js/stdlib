# Anscombe's Quartet

> [Anscombe's quartet][anscombes-quartet].

<section class="intro">

[Anscombe's quartet][anscombes-quartet] is a set of `4` datasets which all have nearly identical simple statistical properties but vary considerably when graphed. [Anscombe][francis-anscombe] created the datasets to demonstrate why graphical data exploration should **precede** statistical data analysis and to show the effect of outliers on statistical properties.

```javascript
var d = data();
/* returns
