*
* ## Notes
*
* -   This function synchronously reads data from disk for each invocation. Such behavior is intentional and so is the avoidance of `require`. We assume that invocations are infrequent, and we want to avoid the `require` cache. This means that we allow data to be garbage collected and a user is responsible for explicitly caching data.

*
* @throws unable to read data
* @returns Anscombe's quartet
*
* @example
* var d = data();
* // returns [[[10,8.04],...],[[10,9.14],...],[[10,7.46],...],[[8,6.58],...]]
