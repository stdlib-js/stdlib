&> EL> Yeah, I was thinking of the G4 keyboard when I wrote this. Otherwise ousy 
&> EL> feel and key placement, though. (That's why I'm holding on to
&> EL> My IBM Model M Space Saver. Once I get an PS2 to USB converter, I
&> EL> expect it will outlive several generations of computer hardware).

The Fingerworks dvorty ergo keyboards are pretty good for that; unfold, plug
the USB port and go, but you don't get the angle unless you put the castiron
(sort of) bracket (and optional gel palm-rests) in your pack.  Big airport fun there.
The flexi-PCB connecting the halves is probably only good for 100,000 flexes too.
(The keyboard is $200-400, hence minor concern.)

Kind of useless for keysigning though; is it not law that when you have to sign,
you will be packed and ready to leave/arrive elsewhere?  Thats why F-u-F-mi
is such a handy accessible proxy signing method and Dragon Naturally
Authorized canceled its IPO.
	Seriously, the nifty Palm thing where you enter your password
and (or by) a series of naturally cryptic buttonpressed and screentaps is a
good method.  Keyed steganography (<---bad term! sorry) is it until I
hear more about spoofed braille.



[the below digresses to laptopianism]



&> EL> Very good for sticking in USB fobs into, though. CRTs/LCD panels are
 even &> EL> better for that, though.

The DPMS connector is supposed to do -what- again?


&> >> near close to keyboard/usb connection as one can get, without the real
&> >> thing)

&> EL> I think laptops are largely useless because of the battery and the
&> EL> keyboard issue.

Once you get something to cut the backlight power low when not needed for
image proofing (or off, in case of FLCD) and cache CDs as virtual devices,
is battery life still bad?

&> Dunno.. Some of the new Sonys (I'm hunting again for a lappy, as the
&> Toshiba I have is a large piece of cow manure)  which promise a 4 hour
&> battery life off of ONE battery are pretty damn impressive.  As far as
&> the keyboard issue, the Toshiba actually came out with a good
&> keyboard, nearly equivalent to most standard keyboards (Not ergonomic,
&> alas, but I have a USB happy ergo keyboard I can always plug in if I
&> get restless).   I can't imagine surviving at Law school without a
&> lappy, but thats just me.

Once used to being surrounded by lawyers with webcams,
I cant imagine being flummoxed dealing with courts.

Lots of the tabletPCs have daylight readable FLCDs.  (From looking
at http://www.infocater.com  I don't know where you'll get Microsoft 
Tablet OS though.)   An item from their handy pres. below.


So after looking at Transmetazone, tell me where (also) stateside I'm 
supposed to be\ shopping for the new Made-for-Japan laptops?

The Sony U series is all Crusoe, but then TigerDirect will be all grins
to sell you a lappad that gets you to 10h on a P4m...maybe a P4, who's to
say Tulatin P4s can't do that massive multithreading trick.
(Besides which, a brown cowpie-colored Dell 8200 with a 
GeForce4Go400-32 is ca. $1550, before you buy car adapters 
and firewire drives.  Popular in OpenGL law school.)

Revamping the Sony C1 every year strikes me as a cruel joke though,
and I don't know any tricks for using 1400x2800 virtual screens on
the lovely NEC LaVie MX and Versa Daylite (FLCDs, 1 yr old) or
Toshiba Libretto L5/080 knkw (the KW has 802.11b built in, maybe
not as good as the 22MBps version or .a)

&> then again, I don't know what you do with your laptops, Gene :)
