This \nbill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The\ncontract has since been executed, \ncommissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.\nWe are left with the balance US$20.5M as part \nof the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for\nour own use. But under our protocol division, we \nas civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This\nis why we are soliciting your assistance in this \nmanner and regard .\n\nAs you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address\nfrom adverts in the business directory . I am the \nChief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )\nof the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation \n( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and\nTROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. \nOfficials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this\nMinistry. We have been exercising patience for this \nopportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity\nwe cannot afford to miss.\n\nWe have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of\nus and I and one of my colleagues \ninvolved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,\nupon the confirmation from you that the Certified \nInternational Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.\n\nConsequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your\ninterest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel \nNo: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and\nCity(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert \nTelephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax\nyou or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS \nTRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get\nthrough.\nNOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please\ninform us so that we can look for another reliable \nperson who can assist in this respect. \n\nIt might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this\ntransaction.
