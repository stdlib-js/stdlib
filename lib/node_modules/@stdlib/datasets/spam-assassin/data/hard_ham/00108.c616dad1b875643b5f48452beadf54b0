This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!
<p>
One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
came down in price. Hearing that the only "officially" functional 
Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?
<p>
At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's 
<a href="http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/">XPlay</a> remains a 
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with 
contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the 
iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch 
Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.
<p>
Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's 
<a href="http://www.sic.org">SIC</a> without a hitch. I just missed a 
face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of 
<a href="http://www.winferno.com">winferno.com</a>, although I'm sure 
we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the 
<a href="http://www.winferno.com/p/lg4/">free copy of Research-Desk</a> 
for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with 
the <a href="http://www.esellerate.net">eSellerate</a> gang, with a 
discussion about <a href="http://www.gnometomes.com">GnomeTomes</a> and 
what the future holds.
<p>
Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my 
<a href="http://www.crosspaths.net">Crosspaths.net</a> connection allows me 
to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

This originally appeared in last weeks Webmaster Weekly, but due to its graphical nature, its worth inclusion here as well:
<p>
"If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent 
background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background 
may appear to be gray rather than transparent."

Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you 
simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.

Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of 
selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price 
of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

<b>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</b> (NR) 1966<br>
Adapted Play - 131min<br>

Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes "Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?"  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a "feel good" movie. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.
