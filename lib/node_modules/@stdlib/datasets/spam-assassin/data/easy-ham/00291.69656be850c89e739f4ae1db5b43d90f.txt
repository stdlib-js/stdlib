I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will
just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of
all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me
who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the
process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up.

In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about "No Key" appear until you
import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example :
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY
(this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages)

Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who
verify against an imported gpg key? This for me would be the optimal way to
ensure integrity with the way things curently work.
