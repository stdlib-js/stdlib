Gregor sez: 

    ENRON Corp material assets go on the block 7 AM CT TOMORROW, Wednesday, 
    9/25. First on the list is the giant, steel, Enron "E" (Lot "E"), followed 
    by tons of cool tech. 50 inch plasma panels, desktop LC Displays, boxes of 
    Palm PDAs or Nokia cell phones, network stuff, wireless stuff, desktop 
    computers, servers, monitors, printers, plotters, in both massive lots, and 
    individually! Oh yeah, Enron trade-show trinkets too, by the cartload. 

    The catch: You have to either go to Texas to pick up the stuff, or arrange 
    with an approved 3rd party vendor (list provided on the web site) to have 
    it picked, packed and shipped for you. 

    Go! Register! Bid! Consume!
