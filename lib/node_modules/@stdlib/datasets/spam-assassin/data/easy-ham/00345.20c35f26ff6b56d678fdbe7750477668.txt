Anybody buying a box like this is undoubtledly going to integrate it into their
crypto infrastructure.  What's the point of putting in a box like this if it's
not an active participant in your security framework?

Blah, blah, blah.  The marketing FUD gets compounded by the Beberg FUD, talk
about 20x bloat.

> Again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...

What gives you the impression that's what they're doing?  That's not what the
text says.  It's largely fluff anyway.

> > "Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly,

Uhhh, fundamentally it's all machine code.  Kelly's comment seems more like
drivel from a clueless marketroid than anything of technical concern.

Having what appears to be a silicon XML router would be a cool thing.  Having
one integrated with your crypto environment would kick ass.  Let it
deserialize/decrypt/repackage the XML before handing it off to the app servers.
The question, of course, is does it work with actual applications in the field
without tremendously reworking them.  Somehow I doubt it...
