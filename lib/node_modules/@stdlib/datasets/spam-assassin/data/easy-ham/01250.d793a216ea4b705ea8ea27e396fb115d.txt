I had been hand building those alsa packages for probably 6 months or more, so I
could use my laptop's ESS chip best (hard disk recording and such). Wow, maybe 8 to
10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I
changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,
it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.

What's more, OSS is fully "imitated", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.

The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.

And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was "muted" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.

Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.

That's "angle" as in geometry.
