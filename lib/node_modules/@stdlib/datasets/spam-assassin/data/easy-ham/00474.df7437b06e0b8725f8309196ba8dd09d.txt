There was a fascinating article in the Economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue
with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that
even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade
and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but
not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile
non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a
significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the
population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for
being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,
etc.

Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.

Some actual data for the US are here:
