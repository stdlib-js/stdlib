Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't 
support the icon window.

However, I did fix some bugs in the related "Hide When Empty" functionality 
which may solve the issue.  You may need to remove "unseen" from the "always 
show sequences" to make this work.  If so, let me know so I can put that in 
the help window for "Icon Window" as it already is for "Hide When Empty".
