These are some good comments and I'd like to share an opinion here.  (Is that permitted? :)

I started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$.  I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.

What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.

I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.
