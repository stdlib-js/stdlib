air after all. This blurb is on [1]their website. 'Time is running short
and we need your help if The Perl Journal is to get another chance at
being the real deal. As of a couple of minutes ago, we only have 881
subscriptions and the deadline is fast approaching. Please subscribe now.
It only costs 3 cents per day to get the best Perl coverage anywhere.'"
They need 3,000 subscribers to move forward.
