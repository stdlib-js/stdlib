[0]Gregor J. Rothfuss writes "There will be a second [1]Open Source CMS
conference this fall in Berkeley. We will feature presentations and
workshops from a wide range of CMS, and would definitely welcome some
Perl-fu in there as well. Also of interest, our efforts to [2]build
bridges across CMS. Participate in our [3]mailing list, or better yet,
[4]show up :)" The [5]first Open Source CMS conference was held in Zurich
this past March.
