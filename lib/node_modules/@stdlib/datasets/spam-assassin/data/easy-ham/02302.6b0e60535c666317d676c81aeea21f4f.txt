Glenn Fleishman's written an open letter to the Infoworld writer who published 
an hysterical ambivalent article[1] about warchalking: 

    The only place I hear about these stories on warchalking that relate to 
    stealing access from open, but not shared APs -- accidentally shared, I 
    suppose is accurate -- is via law enforcement without any specific 
    locations mentioned, arrests made, or even photos of the offending marks.
