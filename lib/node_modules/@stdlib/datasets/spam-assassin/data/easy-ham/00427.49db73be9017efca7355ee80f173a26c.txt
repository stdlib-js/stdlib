Heheheh... So becomming a university professor was your second career 
choice?  ;-)

Seriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had 
many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 
'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a 
spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city 
blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.

As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not 
really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, 
ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There 
have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey 
sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the 
presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?
