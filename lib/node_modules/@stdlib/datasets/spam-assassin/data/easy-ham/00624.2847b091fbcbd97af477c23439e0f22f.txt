Hear hear, Gary.  I'm living with a guy right now who I met at a party, 
emailed with for 2 weeks, then powie!  We were both looking at similar 
goals in life in general, had some attraction for each other, and decided 
to wing it.  I can't say what's going to happen tomorrow, but right now, 
and for the past few months, we've been happy.  Onward Ho!  (:
