[IMG: http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/images/2002/09/25/uncSamMedium.gif (A 
picture named uncSamMedium.gif)][1]Last year on this day[2]: "It's been 
not-correct for most of my life for Americans to say we love our country. 
That's a big bug. We're the world's greatest country and we know it. I love the 
USA. It gave me life, an education, role models and a philosophy. And if you 
think we're stupid or decadent, just try fucking with us."
