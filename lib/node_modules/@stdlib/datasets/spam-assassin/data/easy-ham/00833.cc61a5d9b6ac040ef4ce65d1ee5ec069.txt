act.DTL

Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.

....

To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.

--------

I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.

One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these "virtual holdings" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.
