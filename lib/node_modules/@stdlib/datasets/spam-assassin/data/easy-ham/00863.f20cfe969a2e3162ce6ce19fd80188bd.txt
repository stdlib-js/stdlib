Well I dont have to worry about microwavers in the house. Ours died a week
or so ago and due to doing some research we will nto be getting anysuch
device in the near or far future. I mean even if one half of the crap it
is reported to do is true it s just not worth it for a quick cup or warm
chai.

Which brings me to the fact that finding a good Convection only (not combo
with a microwaver) oven of any good size is dang near impossible unless
you go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which
costco has thru thier online store.

Now of course the question is do we get it delivered to the old house or
the new one (yep we got our offer approved and are in the short run down
to a long mortage:)  we close on oct 31. though the realestate agent says
t happens like that a lot, I still find it incrediably jolting to have
found a house inthe hood I want with the space dawn wants on sunday and we
are signing papers on tuesday night with a close at the end of the month.

Which of course means....wifi land for wsmf:)- )

So far I like the Linksys dsl/cable router all in one wifi ap. The Dlink
has the funky 22mb stuff IF you use all thier stuff across the net and the
way things go I cant say thats gonna happen for sure. Pluse the Linksys
stuff is all over the mass market sotres so I cna walk home with parts at
any time.

The fun now comes with a realization that with ATTbi cable as my main hose
tot he net offering up bwf might be a tad problematic....So i am thinking
of ways around/through/under that. the setup of the particualrs are far
form set in stone...any ideas would be welcome.

Also any portlanders.....party time.
