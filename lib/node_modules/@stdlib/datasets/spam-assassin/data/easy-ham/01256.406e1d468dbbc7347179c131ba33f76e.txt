The "--define" is exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to
figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the
"--with" switches), but for some reason didn't think of using
"--define". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's
back, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email
it to the list for further criticism :)

As far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If
you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
do).

Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch 
to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other 
people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?

P.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They 
greatly simplified what used to take way too long before.
