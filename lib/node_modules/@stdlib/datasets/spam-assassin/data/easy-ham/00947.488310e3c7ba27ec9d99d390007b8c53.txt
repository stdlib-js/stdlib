Most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences.

I'm sure it can be tuned a bunch, but as I'm leaving for a vacation on Friday, 
and have plenty of "real work" to do, I won't be able to do much until I get 
back.

I *will* look at all this when I get back, but if you want to check into 
what's slow and fix things while I'm gone, my feelings won't be hurt.

Chris
