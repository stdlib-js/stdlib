DOOM 3 will use P2P System?

           from the
           i'll-believe-it-when-I'm-fragged-on-it
           dept.
           Ant writes "From Page 6 of FiringSquad's
           QuakeCon 2002 Postmortem article: John Carmack said
           something at the end of the Q&A about how the
           multiplayer will be only four players? Tim: After 2 hours of
           talking up at the podium, sometimes you leave a few details
           out. Doom 3 multiplayer will be fully scalable. It will be a
           peer to peer system. We haven't started working on it yet.
           Tell everyone not to panic - it will be fine. John just forgot
           to mention it'll be scalable past four players. It's hard to
           give a hard number because we haven't started working on
           it yet. Right now we're focused on making Doom 3 a
           kickass, over the top single player game."
