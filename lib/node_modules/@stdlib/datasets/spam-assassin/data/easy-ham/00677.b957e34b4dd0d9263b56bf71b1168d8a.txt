"Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole
societies out of poverty"
I'm not a socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear
examples?

> the Administration's policy.
>
> INTRODUCTION
>
> THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and
> totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of
> freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,
> democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only
> nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and
> guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the
> potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People
> everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;
> worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own
> property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom
> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of
> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of
> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.
>
> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military
> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our
> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for
> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that
> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies
> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and
> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the
> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace
> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace
> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the
> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.
>
> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental
> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed
> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great
> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of
> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less
> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to
> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies
> against us.
>
> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --
> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and
> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global
> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help
> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will
> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the
> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and
> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop
> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every
> turn.
>
> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism
> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking
> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing
> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to
> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other
> means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,
> contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous
> technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America
> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We
> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must
> be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence
> and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who
> saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have
> entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.
>
> As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic
> opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community
> has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the
> seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace
> instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers
> find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist
> violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common
> interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by
> common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching
> for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese
> leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of
> national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political
> freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage
> the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,
> because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and
> international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great
> powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,
> trade, and cultural advancement.
>
> Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend
> the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring
> the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to
> every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us
> that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our
> national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people
> into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and
> corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and
> drug cartels within their borders.
>
> The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a
> better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free
> trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies
> out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual
> nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to
> build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.
> The United States will deliver greater development assistance through
> the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,
> invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also
> continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of
> AIDS and other infectious diseases.
>
> In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is
> guided by the conviction that all nations have important
> responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.
> Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the
> spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international
> aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For
> freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.
>
> We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,
> better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply
> the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed
> to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade
> Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as
> other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment
> these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations
> are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to
> rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.
>
> Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of
> every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has
> been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the
> clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and
> it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity
> holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all
> these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in
> this great mission.

> The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength
> and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of
> liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with
> unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great
> strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that
> favors freedom.
>
> For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great
> struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and
> equality.
>
> That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and
> race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and
> discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we
> are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by
> catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must
> defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.
>
> This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to
> translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,
> and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a
> distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our
> values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help
> make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to
> progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations
> with other states, and respect for human dignity.
>
> And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.
>
> To achieve these goals, the United States will:
>
> * champion aspirations for human dignity;
>
> * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent
> attacks against us and our friends;
>
> * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;
>
> * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our
> friends, with weapons of mass destruction;
>
> * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and
> free trade;
>
> * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building
> the infrastructure of democracy;
>
> * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of
> global power; and
>
> * transform America's national security institutions to meet the
> challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.

> In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we
> stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because
> these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation
> owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and
> mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live
> free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be
> oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of
> the secret police.
>
> America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human
> dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;
> free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;
> religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.
>
> These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served
> us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures,
> facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these
> core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not
> been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and
> aspirations of their people.
>
> Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in
> our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of
> Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a
> stronger, but is a freer and more just society.
>
> Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And
> when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central
> and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When
> we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in
> the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin
> America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can
> evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all
> cherish.
>
> Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,
> the national security strategy of the United States must start from
> these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.
>
> Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international
> cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation
> of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international
> bodies.
>
> We will:
>
> * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of
> human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to
> advance freedom;
>
> * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who
> struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward
> democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;
>
> * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key
> themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation
> from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights
> to move toward a better future; and
>
> * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience
> and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.
>
>
> We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist
> it.
>
> III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent
> Attacks Against Us and Our Friends
>
>
> "Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have
> the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already
> clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been
> waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is
> peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on
> the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of
> our choosing."

> The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of
> global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or
> religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,
> politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.
>
> In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a
> lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed
> within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United
> States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals
> with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who
> knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.
>
> The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in
> our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly
> elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come
> through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some
> unseen.
>
> Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,
> and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to
> achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition
> forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not
> only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of
> trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South
> America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.
>
> Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist
> organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,
> control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will
> have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.
>
> We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a
> coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional
> campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure
> the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial
> tools necessary to finish the task.
>
> The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the
> financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of
> funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who
> support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial
> system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,
> and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative
> financial networks.
>
> However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the
> cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we
> seek.
>
> We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:
>
> * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and
> international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist
> organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of
> terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction
> (WMD) or their precursors;
>
> * defending the United States, the American people, and our interests
> at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it
> reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to
> enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate
> to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by
> acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing
> harm against our people and our country; and
>
> * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists
> by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign
> responsibilities.
>
>
> We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international
> terrorism. This includes:
>
> * using the full influence of the United States, and working closely
> with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are
> illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as
> slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government
> can condone or support and all must oppose;
>
> * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim
> world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote
> terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;
>
> * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by
> enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources
> on areas most at risk; and
>
> * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of
> information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of
> those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.
>
>
> While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also
> strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter
> attack.
>
> This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization
> since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council
> and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland
> Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental
> reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland
> encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public
> and the private sector.
>
> This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example,
> emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with
> terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened
> to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and
> mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop
> terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.
>
> While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism
> in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.
> Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations
> and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where
> governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we
> will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and
> our allies can provide.
>
> As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work

> non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the
> humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to
> rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,
> threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists
>
> In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are
> ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom
> and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this
> conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,
> productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in

> Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional

>
> No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action --

>
> * The United States should be realistic about its ability to help

> Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will

>
> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of

> of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance
> to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace
> for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed
> to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in
> peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a
> government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and
> counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all
> parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and
> comprehensive settlement to the conflict.
>
> The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank
> stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic
> development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to
> establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If
> Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront
> corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support
> for the creation of a Palestinian state.
>
> Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.
> Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the
> United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete
> steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.
> As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw
> fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent
> with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement
> activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides,
> freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians

>
> * Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster

>
> * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development

>
> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are

>
> The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,
> creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to

>
> * expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and
> able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;
>
> * ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate
> combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;
>
> * develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become
> effective multinational fighting forces;
>
> * take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of
> scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that
> they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;
>
> * streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to
> meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of
> training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;
> and
>
> * maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as
> we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.
>
>
> If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a

> take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the

>
> At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still

>
> Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become

>
> It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength.

>
> * assure our allies and friends;
>
> * dissuade future military competition;
>
> * deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and
>
> * decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.
>
>
> The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their
> forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most
> strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must
> confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to
> deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on
> how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might
> occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational
> challenges.
>
> The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound
> symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our
> willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,
> the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of
> power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the
> many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases
> and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as
> well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment
> of U.S. forces.
>
> Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major
> planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate
> across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch
> of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by
> developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision
> strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.
> This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the
> ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure
> U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S.
> infrastructure and assets in outer space.
>
> Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new
> approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S.
> intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and
> technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is
> run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention.
> Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight
> the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a
> wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of
> coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.
>
> We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from
> experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must
> and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy --
> whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United

> sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces
> will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a
> military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the
> United States.
>

>
> We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to
> keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be
> appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems
> and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the
> capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the
> knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek
> the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and
> to maximize injury.
>
> We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide
> integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since
> the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted
> inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of
> information between intelligence and law enforcement.
>
> Initiatives in this area will include:
>
> * strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence
> to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence
> capabilities;
>
> * establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides
> seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing

>
> * continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to
> sustain our intelligence advantage;
>
> * investing in future capabilities while working to protect them
> through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence

>
> * collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the

> As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend

>
> Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out
