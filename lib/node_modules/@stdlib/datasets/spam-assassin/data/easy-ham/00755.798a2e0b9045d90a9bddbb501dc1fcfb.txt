funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally
irresponsible.  which do you think is the worse indictment - overregulation
or overspending?  there are many (dickheads) who buy into the
neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of "liberal" as "one who seeks to
impose both."

hannity and glove.

best quote, wish i could remember who said it: "we tend to describe our own
party by its ideals and our opponents' party by its reality."
