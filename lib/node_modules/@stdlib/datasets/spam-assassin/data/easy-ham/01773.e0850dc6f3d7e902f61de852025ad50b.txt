[0]jhi writes " One of the largely unknown services of CPAN is the
[1]Ports page, which offers links to ready-packaged binary distributions
of Perl for various platforms, and also other related links (to other
UNIXy software, if the platform isn't, and to IDEs and editors). I would
like to get feedback on the ports page either here or by sending email to
cpan@perl.org. Any kind of feedback is welcome, but I will feel free to
ignore any I don't like :-)"
