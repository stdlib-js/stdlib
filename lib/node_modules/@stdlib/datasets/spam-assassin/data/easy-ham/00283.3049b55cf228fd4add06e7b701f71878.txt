Heh. I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors
buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and
drives with known DMA issues as well.

Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can't handle it gracefully you
won't be able to read data off it relably, and that's about it. No
end_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.

My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always
seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same
box, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in
"kudzu-speak". I agree that the %description is the best place for the
tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to
divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or
having that media currently in the drive.
