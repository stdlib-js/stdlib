This was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status.  I think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make
is that there's only two types, speech and action. 
I agree, they are all speech and should be 
covered by the First Amendment, but

If hate speech is so protected, why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it?  There's
only two answers and one of them is wrong.

  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
     have a different level of protection dictated
     by whoever's offended at the time.
  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by 
     any reasonable person. 

Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really "threat".  I think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
don't like.
