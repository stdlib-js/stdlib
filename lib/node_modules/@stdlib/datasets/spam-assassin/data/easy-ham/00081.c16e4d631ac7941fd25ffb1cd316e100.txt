Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or
device drivers - C still rules the world.

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!
