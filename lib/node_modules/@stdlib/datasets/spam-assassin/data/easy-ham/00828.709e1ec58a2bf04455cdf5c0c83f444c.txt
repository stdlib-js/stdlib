No offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a
sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.

My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more
to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth.  (Which is the
gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't
the most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it
was.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to
the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the
people doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don't
support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin
Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think that
this is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a
right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the
folks they elected in the first place.

My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases
such as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts
we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He
has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the
representatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.

I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original
thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming
dissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in
having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the
policy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the
screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from
the folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,
offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply
due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'My
generation never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story,
we just dont' know it all.

I hope this clarifies my position.   For the quick rehash:

Screaming != Free speech on all cases.
Dissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by
the Supremes.

K?
