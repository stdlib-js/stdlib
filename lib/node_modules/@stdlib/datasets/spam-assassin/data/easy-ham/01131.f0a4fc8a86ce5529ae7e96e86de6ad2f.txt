This is true...it's now looking at more than just unseen, so it takes a little 
while (in the background) to build the sequences window.  There is probably 
some tuning possible in this area.

I changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to 
a background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen 
messages may be in.  I *did* ask Brent before I did it.  If you like the old 
behavior, the old lines are still in app-defaults-color, but commented out.

This is because of your Hook_MsgShow_update_unseen which is calling a function 
which no longer exists.

I suspect you need
	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) unseen $msgid
now instead of 
	Mh_MarkSeen $exmh(folder) $msgid
