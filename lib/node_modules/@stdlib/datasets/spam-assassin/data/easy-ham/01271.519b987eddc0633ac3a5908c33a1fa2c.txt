Why "Eek"? :-)
If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/

My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.
