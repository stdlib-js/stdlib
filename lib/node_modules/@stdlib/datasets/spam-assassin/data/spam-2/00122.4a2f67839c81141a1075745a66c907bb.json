I hear about so many \npeople being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, \nI can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address \nand about 90% of the time I can get the number.  \n\nWe are so worried about putting our credit card number on\nthe net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and \nthey take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do \nwho knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person \ntell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy \nof her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that \nperson (me) would have her account info and could write \na check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send \nit to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her \nto tell me what the difference was between the original check \nand a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never \nheard back from her.  \n\nThe bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is \navailable in many places.  Have a good day.\n--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nYes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, \nwe can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most \nimportantly, never give any personal information at a site \nthat is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar \nor a Veri secure sign or others. \n\nAlso, never leave your information stored at a site. I put \nin my credit information in each time instead of having \nan account in standing, a little more time but less risks \ninvolved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet \nmall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is \ndeleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web \nto be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!\n--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com \n~~~~~~~~~\n\nYes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that \nmy ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner \nwas in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  \nMy Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address \nwent unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; \nand, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com \naddress to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building \nup 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place \non 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I \nlost a minimum of $50,000.  \n \nI have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first \ntime I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often \nenough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet \ntheft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals \nand should spend years behind bars.\n \nCustomers are well protected from credit card theft; \nhowever, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by \npurchase order and certified or registered company checks.\n--  Peter S.    http://www.GSSGeomatics.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n               JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED!\nAnd the July 'One-Question Survey' WINNER is...\n\n           John Stitzel   -   oldstitz@yahoo.com\n\n                   Congratulations John!\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nTo change your subscribed address, send both new and old \naddress to mailto:Submit@AEOpublishing.com \nSee the link (below) for our Subscription Center to unsubscribe \nor edit your interests. \n\nPlease send suggestions and comments to: \nmailto:Editor@AEOpublishing.com \nI invite you to send your real successes and showcase \nyour strategies and techniques, or yes, even your total bombs, \n\"Working Together We Can All Prosper.\" \nmailto:Submit@AEOpublishing.com \n\nFor information on how to sponsor Your Membership \nCommunity & Commentary visit: http://bannersgomlm.com/ezine \n\nCopyright 2001 AEOpublishing.com \n------------------------------------------------\nweb: http://www.AEOpublishing.com\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your \nrequest, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.\n\nVisit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.\nhttp://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.8lhtdma6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\n\nView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\n\nPowered by \nConstant Contact(R)\nwww.constantcontact.com\n--1465727098.996838841831.JavaMail.RovAdmin.rovweb003\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n\n<HTML>\n<!-- \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML-FORMATTED MESSAGE BELOW\n\nThe remainder of this message is in HTML format for use by email\nclients that can properly display it.

I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,\n<br>we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most\n<br>importantly, never give any personal information at a site\n<br>that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar\n<br>or a Veri secure sign or others.\n<p>Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put\n<br>in my credit information in each time instead of having\n<br>an account in standing, a little more time but less risks\n<br>involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet\n<br>mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is\n<br>deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web\n<br>to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!\n<br>--&nbsp; Catherine F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com\">http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com</a>\n<br>~~~~~~~~~\n<p>Yes.
