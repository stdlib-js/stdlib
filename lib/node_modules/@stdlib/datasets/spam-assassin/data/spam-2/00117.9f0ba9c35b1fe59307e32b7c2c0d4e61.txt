I also have received both the virus and email on how to get 
rid of it.  Luckily I don't open ANY attachments, unless I'm 
expecting them and then am still very careful.  

Here's the ways I was told to get rid of the thing:

One Fix Tool:

Download fix_sircam.com and run the file. It will scan Drive
C:\ and subfolders and runs in DOS.
http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/security/fix_sircam.com

Another Trojan Fix Tool
http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/FixSirc.com
The fix tool will run from your desktop and will "automatically" 
rid your computer from the SirCam Trojan and clean up an 
entries from your registry files.

After running either fix tool -- reboot your system.

Hope this helps!

Dear Nicety,

As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking 
up your computer I'm afraid your "SOL" as finding a true solution.  
There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts 
resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many 
programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working 
in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a 
regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened 
and closed several different applications.

Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,
wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating
system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at 
http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is 
even truer today.  Every current "worm" you are hearing about 
on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems. 

 So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change 
the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of 
weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running 
I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. 
I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and 
the price is right -- free.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #140:  http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding
Margarete
MDegaston@aol.com
~~~~

I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate 
sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well 
presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been 
a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, 
preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a 
relationship to it.

What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something 
related to the url  "prosperouswomen" to come up, as this 
"word" was what caught my attention and caused me to 
click in the first place.

I feel the book page should be a tool for the "PW" page and 
not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the 
book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.
(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)

With these:

Find out how you can receive the free book.
Email us at directions4U@aol.com        
and
For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing 
write to us at directions4U@aol.com

I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than 
copy and paste.

Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them. 
(and I have ordered the book!)
~~~~

I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.  
Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics 
or where we were headed.
~~~~

Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.

Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish 
between the links and that which is not.

I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also 
linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that 
link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.

If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a 
request message to an aol email address you would get more 
requests, and also might be able to automate this process.
~~~~

I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.
It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.  
If only other sites we so simplistic!
~~~~

With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact 
on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences 
in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box 
with "Life Changeing Insight" needs the 'e' taken out of 
'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended 
to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 
year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of 
using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where 
or how or by whom it was discovered.

The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that 
would make the site more effective (on getting people to request 
the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in 
what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to 
order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form 
for this just about anywhere.

<p>I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate
<br>sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well
<br>presented.&nbsp; In my opinion, the book site could have been
<br>a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site,
<br>preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a
<br>relationship to it.
<p>What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something
<br>related to the url&nbsp; "prosperouswomen" to come up, as this
<br>"word" was what caught my attention and caused me to
<br>click in the first place.
<p>I feel the book page should be a tool for the "PW" page and
<br>not a preface to it.&nbsp; The main site should be the PW and the
<br>book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.
<br>(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)
<p>With these:
<p>Find out how you can receive the free book.
<br>Email us at directions4U@aol.com
<br>and
<br>For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing
<br>write to us at directions4U@aol.com
<p>I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than
<br>copy and paste.
<p>Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them.
<br>(and I have ordered the book!)
<br>~~~~
<p>I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.
<br>Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics
<br>or where we were headed.
<br>~~~~
<p>Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.
<p>Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish
<br>between the links and that which is not.
<p>I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also
<br>linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that
<br>link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.
<p>If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a
<br>request message to an aol email address you would get more
<br>requests, and also might be able to automate this process.
<br>~~~~
<p>I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.
<br>It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.
<br>If only other sites we so simplistic!
<br>~~~~
<p>With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact
<br>on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences
<br>in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box
<br>with "Life Changeing Insight" needs the 'e' taken out of
<br>'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended
<br>to go from side to side. In the first paragraph&nbsp; '... an amazing
100
<br>year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead
of
<br>using the word 'text'.&nbsp; Also it would add credibility to say where
<br>or how or by whom it was discovered.
<p>The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that
<br>would make the site more effective (on getting people to request
<br>the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in
<br>what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to
<br>order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form
<br>for this just about anywhere.
