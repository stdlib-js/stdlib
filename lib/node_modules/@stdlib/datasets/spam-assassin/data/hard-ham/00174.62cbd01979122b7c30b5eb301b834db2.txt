Thanks to Bill Thayer, Ross Sargent, 'Salinas17', Michael Ruggieri,
Maurice O'Sullivan, Terry Gibson, 'mb2400', Bill Kennedy, Paul James
Cowie, Arthur Shippee, Joseph Nicholas, W. Richard Frahm,'alesmonetos',
and Sally Winchester for headses upses this week (a.a.h.i.h.l.n.o.o.)

n.b. Last week I carelessly suggested the team which had claimed
to have found El Dorado was Polish; it is, in fact, an international
team led by a "Polish-Italian" journalist/explorer. Apologies for
any confusion this may have caused.
