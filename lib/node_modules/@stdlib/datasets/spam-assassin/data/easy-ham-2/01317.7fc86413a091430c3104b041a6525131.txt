[001] - abcm2ps 3.1.1 (Development)
  by Guido Gonzato (http://freshmeat.net/users/goccia/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 03:48

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Conversion

About: abcm2ps is a package that converts music tunes from ABC format to
PostScript. Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5, it was developed mainly to
print baroque organ scores that have independant voices played on one or
more keyboards, and a pedal-board. It introduces many extensions to the
ABC language that make it suitable for classical music. 

Changes: Minor bugfixes were made.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 10:52

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Sound Synthesis

About: amSynth is a realtime polyphonic analogue modeling synthesizer. It
provides a virtual analogue synthesizer in the style of the classic Moog
Minimoog/Roland Junos. It offers an easy-to-use interface and synth
engine, while still creating varied sounds. It runs as a standalone
application, using either the ALSA audio and MIDI sequencer system or the
plain OSS devices. It can be played with an external MIDI controller
keyboard, a software virtual keyboard, or through a MIDI sequencer. All
parameters can be controlled over MIDI. 

Changes: The ALSA driver has been MMAPed for improved performance.
Recordings are now output to .wav files. Minor performance tweaks have
been made on the envelope generators, the build process, etc.

  by Avinash Chopde (http://freshmeat.net/users/avinash1/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:10

Text Processing

About: cdlabelgen is a Perl script that generates printouts suitable for
use as CD jewel case inserts or CD envelopes. Both normal sized cases and
slim cases are handled. cdlabelgen can be used to create table of contents
for music CDs, archival CDs, etc., with customizable logos or background
images, and it generates PostScript files as output. The package also
includes a Perl CGI Web script which accepts JPEG images as logos or
backgrounds, and can also create PDF output files.

Changes: It is now possible to specify line width for the cover/tray edges
or to omit edge lines entirely. Control over logo placement has been
added: logos can now be moved and scaled as required on the output.
Support for A4 page printouts has been added.

It also comes with a handy standard library for things like cookie-based
authentication, form handling, HTTP authentication, etc.

Changes: This release adds built-in caching capability and some compiler
optimization.

[013] - DaDaBIK 2.1 beta 
  by Eugenio (http://freshmeat.net/users/eugenio/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 18:36

Database :: Front-Ends

About: DaDaBIK is a PHP application that allows you to easily create a
highly customizable Web interface for a MySQL database in order to search,
insert, update, and delete records; all you need do is specify a few
configuration parameters. It is available in English, Italian, Dutch,
German, Spanish, and French. 

Changes: A new, lighter, and easier to use administration interface
(related to the internal table manager) is now available. The form now has
a better layout, and all the fields are correctly aligned, including
dates. All the translations are now up-to-date. It is now possible, for
select_single fields, to choose "other" during an insert and fill a
textbox by hand with an alternative value. That value will update the
select options, unless the option has been driven with a custom query
("SQL:......"). It is now possible to choose whether a field has to be
displayed on the details page. Other changes and bugfixes have been added.

  by Stelian Pop (http://freshmeat.net/users/spop/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 12:57

System :: Archiving :: Backup
System :: Archiving :: Compression
System :: Filesystems

About: The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines
files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. The
restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups can then be
layered on top of the full backup. Single files and directory subtrees may
also be restored from full or partial backups.

Changes: This release fixes a bug (introduced with 0.4b29) which prevented
the use of a remote tape drive.

Multimedia :: Graphics
Printing

About: Gimp-Print is a collection of very high quality printer drivers for
UNIX/Linux. The goal of this project is uncompromising print quality and
robustness. Included with this package is the Print plugin for the GIMP
(hence the name), a CUPS driver, and two drivers (traditional and
IJS-based) for Ghostscript that may be compiled into that package. This
driver package is Foomatic-compatible and provides Foomatic data to enable
plug and play with many print spoolers. In addition, various printer
maintenance utilities are included. Many users report that the quality of
Gimp-Print on high end Epson Stylus printers matches or exceeds the
quality of the drivers supplied for Windows and Macintosh.

Changes: This release fixes a serious and longstanding problem whereby
prints to certain Epson printers hosted on a Windows system are
incomplete; the bottom of the last page of the print is chopped off. There
are also some minor tweaks for the Epson Stylus Photo 2100/2200.

multiple addresses on a LAN for network simulation. It is possible to ping
the virtual machines, or to traceroute them. Any type of service on the
virtual machine can be simulated according to a simple configuration file.
Instead of simulating a service, it is also possible to proxy it to
another machine.

Changes: UDP support (including proxying), and many bugfixes.

the install was made from a normal package. Unlike other similar products,
IPFS is able to track both shared and statically linked programs. A
Slackware 8.1 package for IPFS is available for download. 

Changes: The old resolve_path shell script has been replace with a newer
and faster ipfs_realpath coded in C.

[046] - Lindenmayer Systems in Python 1.0 
  by Eleventh Hour (http://freshmeat.net/users/xihr/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:52

Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence
Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics
Text Processing :: General

About: Lindenmayer Systems in Python provides a simple implementation of
Lindenmayer systems (also called "L-systems" or "substitution systems").
In basic form, a Lindenmayer system consists of a starting string of
symbols from an alphabet which has repeated transitions applied to it,
specified by a list of transition search-and-replace rules. In addition to
the standard formulation, two alternative implementations are included:
sequential systems (in which at most one rule is applied) and tag systems
(in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the
string). Despite being implemented entirely in Python, for reasonable
rules on a modern machine, the system is capable of running thousands of
generations per second. Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial
intelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal
patterns (usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle
commands), organic-looking patterns that can simulate plants or other
living things, or even music.

[059] - OSSP cfg 0.9.0 
  by Ralf S. Engelschall (http://freshmeat.net/users/rse/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 19:01

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Operating System
Text Processing

About: OSSP cfg is a ISO-C library for parsing arbitrary C/C++-style
configuration files. A configuration is sequence of directives, each
directive consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a
string or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax
has a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with
arbitrarily-nested sections. The configuration syntax also provides
complex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,
hexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, C/C++
and shell-style comments, etc. The library API allows importing of a
configuration text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), traversing the AST,
and optionally exporting the AST again as a configuration text.

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Logging

About: OSSP fsl offers the syslog API otherwise provided by libc. Instead
of writing to the syslogd process, it uses the powerful OSSP l2 logging
capabilities. It is a drop-in link-time replacement which enables any
syslog consumer to take advantage of OSSP l2 by just linking this library
in before libc. The program is intended to apply OSSP l2 functionality to
existing syslog-based third-party programs without the requirement to
change the source code of the program.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 19:01

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Logging

About: OSSP l2 is a C library providing a very flexible and sophisticated
Unix logging facility. It is based on the model of arbitrary number of
channels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with
filtering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave
nodes. Channel trees can be either constructed manually through
lower-level API functions or all at once with a single API function
controlled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. For
generating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided
which can be extended through callback functions. The data flow inside the
channel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are
assigned to each individual channel.

[062] - Papercut NNTP Server 0.8.3 
  by João Prado Maia (http://freshmeat.net/users/jcpm/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:34

Communications :: Usenet News
Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules

About: Papercut is a multi-threaded NNTP server written in Python. Its
main objective is to integrate existing Web-based message board software
(Phorum on the first few versions) with a Usenet front-end. However, its
extensibility enables developers to write their own container for the
storage of the Usenet articles (messages). That means that the code is
extensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the
news server with other Web message board projects or even other ways to
store the messages. 

Changes: The various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial
code for NTTP authentication was added. New features include a standalone
MySQL storage module with no Web front-end, an authentication module for
Phorum, and the concept of a 'read-only' / 'read-write' server with
password protection. Most (if not all) of the features are working.

About: PEANUTS is a console-based Internet user  management system, which
is perfect for  system administrators who normally do things  like adding
virtual hosts or new users by hand.  It allows such tasks to me completely
 automated.

Changes: The directories for Web and system users are automatically
created when the first user is installed. Deletion of users and websites
is now possible. The menu is now somewhat more user friendly. Webalizer
config files are now stored in a users' own directory, and the domains
belonging to each user are now tracked better.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: Message Boards

About: PHPTalk aims to be the fastest and most configurable multithreaded
message board system available. It has the usual features like
multithreading, auto indexing of messages (for searching), customizable

display files, allowing you to template most of the frontend, and allowing
you to specify an already existing user table. Also included is a DBI for
portability, ANSI SQL for portability, an advanced and documented API,
full multilingual support, and full i18n support for date functions. 

Changes: This release has migrated to PEAR. It has an expanded API, major
code cleanups, increased i18n support, and many minor bugfixes.

concurrently. Individual polls can easily be embedded into any PHP or
SHTML Webpage. Creation and modification of polls is made extremely easy
through a Web-based administration page. Sympoll can prevent users from
voting multiple times by using cookies, IP logging, or both.

Changes: This version fixes an important security vulnerability that was
introduced in Sympoll 1.2. There are also several other bugfixes and minor
feature additions.

[086] - The Big Dumb Finger Daemon 0.9.5 
  by Lebbeous Weekley (http://freshmeat.net/users/lweekley/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 03:53

Internet :: Finger

About: The Big Dumb Finger Daemon is a  replacement fingerd for Linux with
new  features and extensive configurability. It gives  the administrator
many options without allowing  an individual user to totally compromise
the  information given out about them. Some of the  new features enhance
user security and  privacy. The daemon is meant to run  standalone, but
will run in inetd mode as well.

Changes: The .plan, .project, .nofinger, and other associated files can be
stored in a common directory and read by bdfingerd, running SUID nobody.
This allows users to have .plan files without giving any permissions to
their home directories.

Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics

About: The Parma Polyhedra Library is user friendly, fully  dynamic,
written in standard C++, exception-safe,  efficient, and thoroughly
documented. 

Changes: Fixes were made for a bug in
Polyhedron::poly_difference_assign(const Polyhedron& y) whereby the
equality constraints of `y' were ignored, a bug in
Polyhedron::operator=(const Polyhedron& y) that should only affect
versions obtained with the `--enable-assertions' configuration flag, a bug
in Polyhedron::check_universe() which was returning the wrong result when
called on a zero-dim universe polyhedron, and a bug in
NNC_Polyhedron::NNC_Polyhedron(ConSys& cs) that should only affect
versions obtained with the `--enable-assertions' configuration flag.

[089] - Trackbox 0.4 
  by Thread (http://freshmeat.net/users/threadbean/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:16

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Players

About: Trackbox is a pure Perl music server. A trackbox client can connect
to the server, and issue commands to it. The server maintains a single
playlist, volume setting, etc. that can be modified remotely by connected
clients. Any file format for which there is a commandline player is
supported, and it has a very simple config file. One possible application
could be a LAN party in which everybody would like to influence the music
selections. 

Changes: This release has playlist save/restore support, a 'move' command
(playlist order), the ability to set the initial play/shuffle/random flag
settings (and start the server in your init scripts), and some other minor
features/changes. There are some clients under development.

[090] - tui-sh 1.2.0 
  by yeupou (http://freshmeat.net/users/mathieur/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 10:13

Utilities

About: tui-sh stands for text user interface in a shell, and is a package
of miscellaneous scripts which are useful for a variety of purposes. They
are all designed to be faster and easier to use than the command line that
would normally be required to accomplish the same task. For example, there
are scripts for mass conversion of WAV files to Ogg files and Ogg files to
WAV files, for converting LaTeX to PostScript and viewing the output in
ggv, for creating image thumbnails, for converting from the Euro to
another currency, and for automated updating via FTP. 

Changes: This release features usage of gettext for internationalization
and getopt.

[092] - Valgrind 1.0.0 
  by sigra (http://freshmeat.net/users/sigra/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 23:04

Software Development :: Testing

About: Valgrind is a tool that helps you find memory management problems
in programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads
and writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as use of
uninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been freed,
reading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing
inappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers to
malloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or
unaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new
[] vs. free/delete/delete []. 

Changes: Support for the x86 fldenv instruction, a fix for an obscure
optimiser bug causing failures like this: "insane instruction 27: PUTFL
%ecx", a fix for dying with bus errors running programs which mess with
the x86 AC (alignment-check) flag, fixes to make it compile and run on Red
Hat "Limbo" (7.3.92), a fix for a possible assert failure having to do
with free() when running cachegrind (not valgrind), and final manual
adjustments.

Education
System :: Systems Administration

About: VNC Reflector is a specialized VNC server which acts as a proxy
between a real VNC server (a host) and a number of VNC clients. It was
designed to work efficiently with large number of clients. It can switch
between different hosts on the fly, preserving client connections. It
supports reverse host-to-reflector connections, it can save host sessions
on disk, and it also has other unique features.  

Changes: Handling of host connections with different desktop geometries
was improved, and support for dynamic changes to desktop size was
implemented. The ability to specify negative display numbers was added. A
few other new features were implemented, and a number of bugs were fixed.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 11:07

Communications :: Email
Communications :: Email :: Mail Transport Agents
Communications :: Email :: Post-Office :: POP3

About: vpopmail (vchkpw) is a collection of programs and a library to
automate the creation and maintenance of virtual domain email
configurations for qmail installations using either a single UID/GID or
any valid UID/GID in /etc/passwd with a home directory. Features are
provided in the library for other applications which need to maintain
virtual domain email accounts. It supports named or IP-based domains. It
works with vqadmin, qmailadmin, vqregister, sqwebmail, and courier-imap.
It supports MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, LDAP, and file-based (DJB constant
database) authentication. It supports SMTP authentication combined with
the qmail-smtp-auth patch. It supports user quotas and roaming users (SMTP
relay after POP authentication). 

Changes: This release adds one last patch for the vgetent problem,
comments out the lseek definition for BSD users, replaces the old
qmail-pop3d-maildirquota patch with the qmail-maildir++ patch (which adds
Maildir++ support not only to qmail-pop3d, but also to qmail-local), and
updates the documentation.

[095] - Vstr string library 0.9.9 
  by Nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:14

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. It works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la "C strings". It can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

Changes: The vstr_export_buf() function now performs automatic bounds
checking in the same way as vstr_export_cstr_buf(). vstr_sc_read_*() now
works even if the vstr isn't configured to have an iovec cache. Work on
internal symbol hiding has been made, making the library smaller and
faster.

[100] - WebFileManager 0.972 (Stable)
  by horsburgh (http://freshmeat.net/users/horsburg/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 16:56

Desktop Environment :: Window Managers
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: FileManager is a secure (SSL), multi-user, and Web- based program
for file, directory, and remote  command management. It is written in
Perl, for  Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It displays  full
directory information; allows file viewing,  deleting, renaming,
uploading, downloading, etc.;  assists in directory navigation; and can
execute  any command for which the user account has  privilege.
FileManager also comes with a built-in  text editor for quick editing and
file updates. 

Changes: A security hole that allowed authorized users to view any file on
the system has been fixed. The security certificate has been extended.
Support has been added for 29 more OS types. The find function now works
for non-root, jailed users. A new option controls whether or not a user
can "click" outside their home directory tree. The AllowRootUser parameter
can now disable the 'root' user. A bug that prevented non-root, jailed
users from creating subdirectories, a "group" permissions access problem,
and a bug in the "Command Line" box which prevented using the asterisk
wildcard have all been fixed.

Security
System :: Monitoring
System :: Systems Administration

About: WebJob downloads a program over HTTP/HTTPS and executes it in one
unified operation. The output, if any, may be directed to stdout/stderr or
a Web resource. WebJob may be useful in incident response and intrusion
analysis as it provides a mechanism to run known good diagnostic programs
on a potentially compromised system. It can also support various
host-based monitoring solutions. 

Changes: Under the hood, the project went through some significant
restructuring, primarily to make room for three new platforms: NT/2K,
Cygwin, and MacOS X. The default installation directory has changed for
Unix platforms (it is now in /usr/local/integrity).

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 18:39

Text Editors

About: The goal of the XMLtype project is to create a console-based editor
of XML document-oriented files in UTF-8 encoding. It is designed from the
beginning for multilingual use, even for writing bi-directional texts
(e.g. mixed English and Hebrew). The design focuses on comfortable and
fast typing of well-formed XML documents. Thus XMLtype is not meant to
compete with advanced console editors like Emacs or VIM. For full
functionality, XMLtype requires UTF-8 console support. It is being
developed under Linux and for the ANSI/VT-100 terminal. 

Changes: This release fixes an ugly I/O bug caused by previous bugfixing.
