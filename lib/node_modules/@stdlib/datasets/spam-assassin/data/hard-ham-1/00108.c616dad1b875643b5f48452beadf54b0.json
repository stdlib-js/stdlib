Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions \ncame down in price. Hearing that the only \"officially\" functional \nWindows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my \nopinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great \nfree players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software \nplayer in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?\n<p>\nAt first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true \nWindows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional \nfunctionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's \n<a href=\"http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/\">XPlay</a> remains a \nbetter option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an \niPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with \ncontact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the \niPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch \nJukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.\n<p>\nLori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's \n<a href=\"http://www.sic.org\">SIC</a> without a hitch. I just missed a \nface-to-face introduction to John Lal, of \n<a href=\"http://www.winferno.com\">winferno.com</a>, although I'm sure \nwe'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the \n<a href=\"http://www.winferno.com/p/lg4/\">free copy of Research-Desk</a> \nfor all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with \nthe <a href=\"http://www.esellerate.net\">eSellerate</a> gang, with a \ndiscussion about <a href=\"http://www.gnometomes.com\">GnomeTomes</a> and \nwhat the future holds.\n<p>\nEvery time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is.

Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of \npresence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, \nyou may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live.

At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes \"Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?\"  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a \"feel good\" movie. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.\n\n\n\n \n\n<ul>\n<li>Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only)\n<li>Format: Black and White, Widescreen Anamorphic, Closed Captioned\n<li>Sound: (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n<li>Production Notes\n</ul>\n\n\n<p class=\"url\" align=\"right\">Review by <a href=\"mailto:brett@lockergnome.com?subject=DVD Review Feedback\">Brett Trout</a>\n\n\n\n\n<!-- WALLPAPER -->\n<p><br><table bgcolor=\"#A9C4CF\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p class=\"title\">&nbsp;GnomeWALLPAPER</p></td></tr></table><p>\n\n<!-- http://www.deviantart.com/output/lockergnome_newsletter-skin.html -->\n\n<!-- Begin Featured Skin -->\n<span class=\"author\"><b>purple flower for <a title=\"WallPapers Website\" target=_blank HREF=\"http://www.wincustomize.com\" >WallPapers</a></b> by tatosh</span><br>\n<img height=6 src=\"/images/blank.gif\" width=1>\n<font size=\"1\">Posted on 7/17/2002 12:35:01 AM  -- &nbsp;&nbsp; </font>\n<p align=\"center\"><center>\n<img BORDER=0 SRC=\"http://www.wincustomize.com/library/accounts/tatosh/wallpapers/tpurpleflower.jpg\" ALT=\"purple flower by tatosh\" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></center>\n<p></p><p align=\"center\">\n<font size=\"2\">\n\n[<a title=\"Download purple flower\" HREF=\"http://www.wincustomize.com/skins.asp?flags=skinid=3984|library=8|file=purpleflower.zip\" >Download</a>]\n&nbsp;--&nbsp;[<a title=\"View Large Image\"  target=_blank HREF=\"http://www.wincustomize.com/library/accounts/tatosh/wallpapers/purpleflower.jpg\" >Zoom</a>]\n&nbsp;--&nbsp;[<a title=\"Visit WinCustomize\" target=_blank HREF=\"http://www.wincustomize.com/skins.asp?library=8&SkinID=3984\" >Visit WinCustomize</a>]\n</font></p><br>\n<!-- End Featured Skin -->\n\n\n<!-- ADMINISTRIVIA -->\n<p><br><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tr><td><p class=\"sidebar\">\n<table bgcolor=\"#A9C4CF\" cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tr><td>\n<font style=\"font-size: 8pt\" face=\"Verdana, Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial\" size=\"1\">\n<a href=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/digitalmedia/20020717.html\">http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/digitalmedia/20020717.html</a><br>\n<p>Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the <A HREF=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/changesub.html\">subscription management</A> page.
