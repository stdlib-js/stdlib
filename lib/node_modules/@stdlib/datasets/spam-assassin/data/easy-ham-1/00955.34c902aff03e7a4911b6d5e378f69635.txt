You can also duplicate thiswith

MsgChange - noshow

at the Tcl prompt in the Log window.  I suspect that the sequence
parser, which understands things like 5-22 to mean messages 5 through 22
is confused when asked to add/remove message "-" from a sequence.

If we are allowed to assume 8.2 or higher, which we can't really, then
we could add

if {![string is integer $select(sel)]} {
   # bail out of message select mode
}
to the SelectTypein procedure.

We can probably survive with

if {![regexp {^[0-9]+$} $select(sel)]} {
    #bail out of message select mode
}
