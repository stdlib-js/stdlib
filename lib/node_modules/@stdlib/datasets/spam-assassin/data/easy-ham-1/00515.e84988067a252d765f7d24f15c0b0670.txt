So Eugen, how many of your homo friends have -had- 3k lovers?

In fact, thats a general question for FoRK proper.

Do you know anyone, outside of meybee Wilt Chamberlin and a few of the
gang-bang porn queens who -have- had even 1.5k lovers?

Eegads, if you're hypothesizing numbers like -that- Eugen, you at
least owe it to FoRK to back that shit up.

Otherwise we're liable to assume rampant unfounded homophobia and that
would just be a lose.

Just a quick assumption here.   I'm not a math geek or anything, but
assuming 1 lover every day, that would be like at least one lover
everyday for 8 years and some change.   I don't know about you, but
very very few of us are -that- lucky (or even close to that lucky)
and after awhile, even the sexaholics get bored and have to mingle
something new into their weekends.   You really are assumiing that the
homosexual population is a) that large in a given area (The meccas
might qualify, but try finding that kind of homosexual population in
say, Tulsa, Oklahoma or Manchester, NH (Tho Manchester does have quite
a few nifty gaybars, but thats a different story)  b) that bored/sex
obsessed/recreationally free to pursue sex that often, with that many
partners or that they'd even WANT that many partners.

Qualify yourself, or at least lower your outrageous numbers.
