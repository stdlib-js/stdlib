Nah, didn't say art's our priority.  Said our ideas about relationships 
and love are.

I see it a lot in the south. Also family.

One thing that's wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters.  Too many 
kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
efficiently for how their kids are taught.
