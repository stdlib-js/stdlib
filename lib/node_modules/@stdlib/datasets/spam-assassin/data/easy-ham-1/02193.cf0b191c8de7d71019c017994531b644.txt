Kevin "Free Kevin" Mitnick and Steve "Woz" Wozniak co-hosted an episode of The 
Screen Saver on Tech TV, where Woz autographed one of the laptops that Kevin 
got arrested for using. Now that machine, signed by both net-celebs, is up for 
sale on eBay. 

    This is the Toshiba Satellite T1960CS, 486 laptop computer seized by the 
    FBI on February 15, 1995, in Raleigh, NC, during the arrest of the world's 
    most celebrated computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick. The laptop is working and 
    has been loaded with a fresh version of Windows 95. A shrink-wrapped 
    version of Windows 95 on floppy, is included with the laptop. The laptop is 
    a 486DX with a color LCD, detachable trackball mouse, AT&T 14.4 PCMCIA 
    modem card, power adapter and documentation in FBI evidence bags. The 
    laptop has been signed on the bottom by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple 
    Computer, and says, "You've got the whole world in your hands. --Woz (Free 
    Kevin!). It is also signed by Mitnick himself. The system was shown on the 
    September 27, 2002 episode of The Screen Savers on TechTV, where the 
    signatures on the bottom were authenticated in a special show hosted by 
    Wozniak and Mitnick. A tape of the show will also be included.
