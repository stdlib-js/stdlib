It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you
visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party
officials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the
mail.  

Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.

But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, 
but so what.
