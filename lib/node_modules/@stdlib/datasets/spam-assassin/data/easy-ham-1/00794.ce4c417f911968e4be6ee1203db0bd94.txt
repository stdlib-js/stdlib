In essence, hindsight justification.  The progressives weren't in the
middle, they were in a society at one end and they wanted a society at
the other end.  The middle is more or less where they got stopped.

As to an intervention that worked, I actually have some nice things to
say about the SEC, at least in theory.  I have a few nasty things to say
as well, but on the whole it has been a very good thing.
