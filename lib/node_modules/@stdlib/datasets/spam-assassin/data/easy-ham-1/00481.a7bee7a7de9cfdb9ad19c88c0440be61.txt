I recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, "Electronic
Publishing", which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995.
All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first
journals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of
the better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly
from 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).

Today's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,
since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this
journal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top
researchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the
ideas that led to many Web technologies.  It's one source among many for
sifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing
technologies.

Rohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in the
context of their WWW7 "Evolution of Document Species" paper:

Page Description Languages: Development, Implementation and Standardization:
A. L. Oakley and A. C. Norris

Important papers in the history of document preparation systems: basic
sources:
Richard K. Furuta
http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/volume5/issue1/ep057rf.pdf
(Excellent overview of sources)

Several of the authors of papers in this journal are now involved in the ACM
Document Engineering conference series:
