  | Interesting...I don't think this was my bug.
  | It appears that Msg_Change was asked to change to message "-".

Something like that is quite possible, but perviously typing nonsense
in didn't cause tracebacks, and now it does, and the traceback came
from the sequence code...

Perviously this would have just caused red messages in the status
line complaining about my lousy typing.   That's probably what it
should keep on doing (the "red" part isn't important obviously..)
