Good way, heres one that worked for me.

Work on a database project with that person. After a while hand her the
keyboard to go get some lunch.

If when you come back she is talking to the person in the next cube about
survivor all the time you were gone...go for the one night boom boom plan

If when you return she has read thru the help screen to try to figure out
what your working on...go fro the week long dine and do with options for
more IF she finishes the help docs and does some code.

If when you come back she has done some  work on the db's infrastructure,
cleaned up your code and made a few  "additions" to make it work
better and figures that since you have done enough work for the day  asks
that you bring lunch and your lap top to the big  screen projection room
to watch your new DVD of startship troopers..marry her
