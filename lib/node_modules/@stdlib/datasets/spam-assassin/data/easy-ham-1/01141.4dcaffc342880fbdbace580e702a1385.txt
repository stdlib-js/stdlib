	As Hal noted, I like to have the unseen window visible in all
virtual desktops, even if the main window is minimized. However, I looked
through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling "Show
unseen message count in folder cache". Where is that? And in what version?
(I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)

	I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.
Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew
it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my 
~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the
settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded
state, etc. 
	I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at
1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)
	Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section:

NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
DESKTOP: 0
RES: 1600 1200
WH: 114 173
XY: 1655 150 0 0
LAYER: 4
STICKY: 1
SKIPTASK: 0
SKIPWINLIST: 0
SKIPFOCUS: 0
SHADE: 2
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE

	I changed:
XY: 1655 150 0 0  	to 
XY: 1455 150 0 0	so it would reappear in my viewable space,
restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!
There was my window! 

	I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that
window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so:

NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE

	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how
it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off
screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when
shading.)

	Hmm. Weird. 

	Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, folks. Hopefully this will be
useful to someone scouting the archives in the future... :-)
