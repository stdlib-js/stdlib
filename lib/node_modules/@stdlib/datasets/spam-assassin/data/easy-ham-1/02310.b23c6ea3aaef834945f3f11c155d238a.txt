_Slashdot_: Digital Camera Quality Passing Film?[1] We just hired a 
photographer for our wedding yesterday, Light Touch Imagery[2]. They offer 
competitive prices; they can design the type of albums we want (with some 
amount of artistic touchup); they do bridal and engagement portraits as well as 
full wedding day coverage; they shoot all digital; and they give us all the 
digital negatives on CD&#8212;that is, the raw pictures that come straight out 
of their cameras. No other photographer we met with came close.
