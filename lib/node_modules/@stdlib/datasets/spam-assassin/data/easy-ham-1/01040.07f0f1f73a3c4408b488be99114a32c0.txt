Well, from what I've tried, both the main and the PCM (at least) volume
levels can be controlled either by "alsamixer" or the good old "aumix".

I guess/hope some other people from the list will try it out ;-)

Both problems you reported (libasound.so and wrong xine dependency) are now
fixed in the current packages.

Oh, it's maybe also worth pointing out : I've implemented at last sorting
by both last change date and alphabetically for my "build list" in the php
code : http://freshrpms.net/builds/

And yes, I accept patches/comments/suggestions about all those spec files!
