That sounds like fun. But it sets the wrong precedent.
Here's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon
cruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse
day sailor. Under way, ask her if she'd like to take
the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something
simple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served
in the cockpit, with an inexpensive but potable wine.

If she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If
she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs
another coat, and asks what you're using on it,
propose on the spot.
