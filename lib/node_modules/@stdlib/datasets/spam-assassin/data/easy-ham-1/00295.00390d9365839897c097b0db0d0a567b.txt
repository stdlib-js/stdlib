An investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich 
were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.

Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.

Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.

The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.

So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.

Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: "This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.

"Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents."
