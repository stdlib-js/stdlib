Interview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like: 

    Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, "Hey, great to see you. 
    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes." 

    GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman. 

    RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
    cigarette, and you say, "Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
    Here's my documents. How's the road?" Just small talk, because these guys 
    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
    have to be cool.
