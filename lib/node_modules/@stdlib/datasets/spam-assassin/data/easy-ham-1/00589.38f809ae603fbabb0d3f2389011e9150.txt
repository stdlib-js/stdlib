Maybe you never bought a hot dog from a street vendor.

Well, yes.  But it doesn't change the idea that the margin of survival
probably IS that thin in this region.

I'm not.  I'm sure both sides were equally ready to be the aggressor
provided they were in a predominant position of power.

1. Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.
2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.
3. US Leadership remains reflexively multi-cultural.
