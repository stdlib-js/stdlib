I may be wrong but I think a single select entry field is used
for selecting messages and switching folders. Restricting the entries
to be numeric would break the folder switching functionality, wouldn't
it?

My version of MsgChange, not yet updated, has a check

    if {$msgid != {}} {
	# Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line instead
	if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } else {
    ...

at the start of the procedure which takes care of the single '-' case.
Perhaps the thing to do is for MsgChange to validate a msgid as a
number before continuing.
