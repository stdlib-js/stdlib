I was just offering anecdotal first-hand experiences from a number of
cultures indicating 1) we apparently have a problem 2) which requires more
than ad hoc hand-waving approach (it's trivial! it's obvious! all we have
to do is XY!).

That's easy. Divorce didn't happen. The church and the society looked
after that. Only relatively recently that privilege was granted to kings, 
and only very recently to commoners.

Is Saudi Arabia a meaningful emigration source?

I wasn't talking about the US specifically. (Though the demographics 
problem exists there as well, albeit not in that extent we Eurotrash are 
facing right now).

1) I'm seeing lack of innovation, and -- more disturbing -- trend towards
even less innovation by an autocatalytic process (gerontocracy favors
gerontocracy).

My point was that the west, US first and foremost, importing innovation
carriers and working against bad trend in the demographics by large scale
import. While this kinda, sorta works on the short run, this is not
something sustainable.
