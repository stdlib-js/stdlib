Make sure you rebuild as root and you're in the directory that you
downloaded the file.  Also it might complain of a few dependencies but
you can get these at freshrpms.net, except for gcc3, which you can find
on your Red Hat cd, Red Hat ftp, or rpmfind.net.

After you rebuild the source rpm it should install a binary rpm in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386.  With all dependencies met, install mplayer
with 'rpm -ivh mplayer-20020106-fr1.rpm' and you should be good to go.

One last thing, you will need the win32 codecs, I found them on google,
create a directory /usr/lib/win32 and place the codecs in there.

Good Luck!

Lance
