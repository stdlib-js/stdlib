Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if
you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert
into apt and let loose... :)

Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as
up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another
repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The
updates.
