[IMG: http://boingboing.net/Images/luckystack1.jpg]Tim Biskup is an artist who 
does a lot of work for animation studios. His work is inspired by one of my 
favorite illustrators, Jim Flora. Tim's selling a deck of poker cards, each 
with a different illo, and they look terrific. Lots of whimsical monsters and 
happy monkeys and weird prehistoric plants. I pre-ordered my deck just now. 
Hurry, only 2500 decks will be printed! Link[1] Discuss[2]
