The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant 
points in its favor, it still manages to suck, and break across JVMs.

I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like 
java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU 
compiler collection.   But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere 
because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are 
probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.   When I looked at 
what I had to do to gcc and link "hello world," I lost interest.

Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway?   Why are Perl/Python/Ruby 
more reliable?   In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code 
utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single 
portable JVM that just works.

My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze 
browser java implementations.
