I wish I could answer your question but my laptop does not have the digital stuff
hooked up :( so I so not know about it. I have an excellent ESS Maestro3 which OSS
supports pretty lame so I was forced to learn about ALSA.

I have used these commands to explore ALSA and my chip:

arecord -l   (list devices)
arecord -L   (list PCM decices)

I get some output like this:

> arecord -l
card 0: MAESTRO3 [ESS Allegro PCI], device 0: Allegro [Allegro]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

> arecord -L
PCM list:
 (SNIP - craploads of output)

I noticed that the output from this commands kind of maps to what the alsamixer or
gamix have.

For what it is worth, here is what I have in modules.conf for my sound stuff:

> ## ALSA portion
> alias char-major-116 snd
> ## OSS/Free portion
> alias char-major-14 soundcore
>
> ## ALSA portion
> alias snd-card-0 snd-maestro3
> ## OSS/Free portion
> alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0

Hope that helps, good luck.

That's "angle" as in geometry.
