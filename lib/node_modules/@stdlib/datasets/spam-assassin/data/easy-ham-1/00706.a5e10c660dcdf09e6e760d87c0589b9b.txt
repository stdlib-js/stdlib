reminds me of Cheney during the VP debates, when he declared his wealth was
not the product of government favors.

Lovely quote from the Forbes 400 list:
"and not a single Astor, Vanderbilt or Morgan rates a mention on the
current Forbes Four Hundred. "

But you have to studiously ignore the 4 Rockefellers, 3 Gettys, 3
Hearsts,  Fords, Kelloggs, Wrigleys,
and so on.

There are more self-made people on the list than I previously alluded to
- I made a mistake. Most
of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League dropouts,
suggesting to me that they weren't
exactly poor to start with. Some of them have lovely self-made stories
like:
#347, Johnston, Summerfield K Jr
