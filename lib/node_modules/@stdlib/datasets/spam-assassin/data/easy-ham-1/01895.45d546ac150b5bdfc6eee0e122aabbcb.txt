Moller, a public company in Davis, California, has developed a flying car.  

    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/flyingcar.jpg] Moller International 
    has developed the first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal 
    vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen. 

    You've always known it was just a matter of time before the world demanded 
    some kind of flying machine which would replace the automobile. Of course, 
    this machine would have to be capable of VTOL, be easy to maintain, cost 
    effective and reliable. Well, we at Moller International believe we have 
    come up with the solution. That solution is the volantor named M400 Skycar.
