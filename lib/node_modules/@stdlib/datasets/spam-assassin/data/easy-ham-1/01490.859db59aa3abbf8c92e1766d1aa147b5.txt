As Dan said -- it's a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data.

Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can't be
directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no "blind" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.

In 2.42, they're evaluated "blind", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.
