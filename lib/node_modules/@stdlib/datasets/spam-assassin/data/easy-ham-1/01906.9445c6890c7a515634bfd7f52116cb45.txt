A new KPMG study concludes that the RIAA and its member companies are hurting 
themselves by focusing on cracking down on P2P sharing instead of figuring out 
ways to earn a living with it. 

    Media companies must put less emphasis on protecting digital content and 
    instead find ways to make money from digital music and movies if they hope 
    to beat back copyright pirates who threaten their businesses, according to 
    a study released on Wednesday from KPMG... 

    "They complain about the Napsters," she said, referring to the bankrupt 
    music swap site that was found to violate U.S. copyright laws. "But why do 
    the Napsters exist, because the marketplace wants them." 

    Steel said that if the issue "is not on boardroom table ... then that 
    boardroom has problems."
