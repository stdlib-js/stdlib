* Minimum Premium to Endow is a hypothetical, non-guaranteed premium
that, based on current charges and the current interest rate, would keep
the policy in force to age 100. Interest rates and charges will change
over time, as will the Minimum Premium to Endow. These premiums are
shown as hypothetical figures based on the stated assumptions and are
shown for comparative purposes only. The actual premium needed to keep
the policy in force is based on actual results and may be higher or
lower. ** All guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the
issuer.
