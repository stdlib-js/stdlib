Nigeria who died along with his entire family of a wifeand two children in
Kenya Airbus (A310-300) flight KQ430 in November2000.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin tocome
over

family member nor distant relative hasappeared to claim the said fund.  Upon
this discovery, I and other officialsin my department have agreed to make
business with you release the totalamount into your account as the heir of

bank, other wisethe fund will be returned to the bank treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 30%for
you as
foreign partner and 70% for us the officials in my department.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, my colleague and I
willcome to
your country and mind our share. It is from our 60% we intendto import
computer
accessories into my country as way of recycling thefund.  To commence this
transaction we require you to immediately indicateyour interest by calling
me
or sending me a fax immediately on the aboveTelefax # and enclose your

banking co-
 ordinates to enable us fileletter of  claim to the appropriate department
for
necessary approvalsbefore the transfer can be made.
