The following was personal correspondence between two people.  I can't
fathom how Razor thinks it is spam:

>
> We are struggling with the decisions related to wether or not to
> go ahead with our plans to purchase an OCR and forms
> scanning solution.
>
> An outside consultant mentioned that he had heard that not to
> long ago you folks were considering implementing OCR
> technology to reduce data entry costs and improve efficiency.
> If you could let us know if you did move foreward with any
> plans in that direction it would be of great help to us. May I ask
> what initialy prompted you to consider OCR? Did you decide it
> could help your compamy? What software did you go with?
> Would you recomend we take a look at it?
> At present we are still planning to continue our research until
> we decide which OCR system best suits our needs, then
> implement it quickly.
>
> If you are just starting to consider this
> technology feel free to stay in touch. We will let you know what
> we decide on and if it works for us.

> If you cannot advise on this please forward this E-mail to the

> Thanks,
> Jay
