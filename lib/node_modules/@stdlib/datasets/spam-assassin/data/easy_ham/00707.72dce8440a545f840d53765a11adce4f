A worthy study procrastination tool: )

A few choice phrases from ol dubya himself:

"And all our history says we believe in liberty and justice for all,
that when we see oppression, we cry."

"If you want to keep the peace, you've got to have the authorization to use force.
-- White House, Sep. 19, 2002"

"The United States will remain strong in our conviction that we must not, and will not,
 allow the world's worst leaders to hold the United States and our friends and allies blackmail,
 or threaten us with the world's worst weapons."  -- Whats truly sad
 about the "United States and our friends and allies /blackmail/, is
 that he said the same thing in the SAME speech in a paragraph or two
 before.


 "If you find a neighbor in need, you're responsible for serving that neighbor in need,
  you're responsible for loving a neighbor just like you'd like to
  love yourself."
  -- Snerk.   This just begs for potty-mouth comedy.  Too bad the kids
  on southpark just aren't that political.

  "I want to send the signal to our enemy that you have aroused a compassionate and decent and mighty nation, and we're going to hunt you down.
-- No, I didn't make this one up. Louisville, Kentucky, Sep. 5, 2002
