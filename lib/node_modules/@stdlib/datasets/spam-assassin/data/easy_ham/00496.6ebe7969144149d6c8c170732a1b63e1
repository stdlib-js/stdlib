An example:  Being able to model RF propagation in three dimensions for a
metro area when deploying wireless networks.  By having every single tree
and building detail and similar, you can "see" even tiny dead spots due to
physical blockage and signal attenuation.  Overlay this with fiber map data
for yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which is
also useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modeling
existing network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further
deployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.  Take that and tie it into a
slick geo-physically aware real-time network monitoring and management
system and you've really got something...

For many applications though, 5-meter data is probably adequate.
