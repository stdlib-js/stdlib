Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type "make" after I get the output from the ./configure. 

However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
* cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config
* make oldconfig
* make dep
The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?

Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed "make", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after "make". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory

The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?

It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric
