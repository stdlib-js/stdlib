SixDegress is a $99 OS X app that data-mines your own hard-drive and tries to 
build links between people, files and folders. Laura Carpenter at the OS X con 
was talking it up yesterday and it looks way cool -- I've just downloaded the 
demo to play with. 

    * Locate files with similar names or file revisions, anywhere on your 
    system.

    * Show all email threads related to any file or person on your desktop.

    * View all the files a person has sent you, regardless of where those files 
    are stored on your computer.

    * Create dynamic, self-updating projects.

    * Find misfiles or attachments quickly without searching desktop folders.

    * Navigate and open any message, file or person on your desktop in one 
    click.
