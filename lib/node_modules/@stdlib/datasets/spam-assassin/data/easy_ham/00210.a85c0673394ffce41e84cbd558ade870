Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.
Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
what the problem might be give me a shout.

Cheers,
Peter.
