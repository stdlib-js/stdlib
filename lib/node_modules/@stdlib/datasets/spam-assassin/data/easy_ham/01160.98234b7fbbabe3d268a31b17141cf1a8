  | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
  | color in the ftoc.

That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.

I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.

  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
  | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.

OK.

  | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
  | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.

In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
"all unknown" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)

  | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar.   I ended up using

*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.
