It's all here in these 10 lines, otherwise known as the
"I'll try my damnest to paste something" procedure:

# Return the current selection (from any window) or cut buffer 0.
proc Text_Selection {} {
    if [catch {selection get} sel] {
        if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
            if [catch {cutbuffer get 0} sel] {
                return ""
            }
        }
    }
    return $sel
}

This is in textSelection.tcl, and is what exmh uses to find text to paste.
It is that last "cutbuffer get" that is wacky, because exmh sticks its
own deletions into that little know stash, and is probably the only
application on the planet that still looks there.  We should probably
just disable that - try this variant:

proc Text_Selection {} {
    if [catch {selection get} sel] {
        if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
            return ""
        }
    }
    return $sel
}

Everything funnels through here, so you just need to hack this one spot.
