I'm not familiar with Dell Dimension XPS, and, to be honest, not familiar
with any brand-name computers. Most of my experience is China
motherboards, but I've seen same behavior once. Changing the battery helps
that time. It was big round battery with 'Panasonic' on it.
Computer starts beeping then we removed battery from MB. It even booted up
(well, loosing time and some other things).

Just my 2 cents.
