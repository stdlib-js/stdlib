One thing I _think_ you might be doing slightly wrong is your
specification of prefixes.  --prefix is the directory to be used as root
for _installing_ files.  Typically packages use /usr/local as default
(so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in
/usr/local/doc and so forth).
Normally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not
further specify things like --exec-prefix.

Maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, in
which case ignore me!

I'd make the same remarks about prefixes here.  I would use the command
    ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local

To get w3 to compile, I think the with-url flag you should use is
    --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/
(Assuming you compiled/installed url with --prefix=/usr/local
Since you appear to have installed url in /url/url, configure w3 with
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lisp

A command you would have found useful would have been
    find / -name 'url-vars.el' -print
Which would have told you where the url-vars.el file was installed.

A program which is very useful is checkinstall
http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/
It allows you to install packages from source while still registering
them in the package management system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz).
Instead of "make install" type "checkinstall", and a package is put
together and installed for you.  Makes uninstallation simpler than it
might otherwise be.
