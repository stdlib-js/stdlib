Disney's put up a little brochureware site about its forthcoming (and very 
exciting!) film based on the Haunted Mansion ride, a followup to the Country 
Bears movie (I may be the only adult in the world who enjoyed that one). All 
that's there now is a downlaodable poster, which is pretty keen, except for 
this supercillious bit of legal crapola you have to click through to get at it.

    any rights other than as explicitly set forth below. 

    You shall receive HTML code and GIF file (the "Files") from Disney Pictures
