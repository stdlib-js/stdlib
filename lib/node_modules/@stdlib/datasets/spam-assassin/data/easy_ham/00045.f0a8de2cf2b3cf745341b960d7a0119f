Exsqueeze me, but what part of "I don't know if it's true or not"
did you fail to grok?  I personally doubt it simply because I never
heard of Bush and Chirac going to Brighton.

Next time I hear a joke, I promise not to laugh until I have checked
out primary sources for confirmation in triplicate, OK?  Good thing
we have you around to keep us on the straight and narrow, all the while
inundating us with such erudite profundities as "Kill your idols folks",
"fight the powers that be, from with out and from with in" and innumerable
other dippy bromides.
