This is something new, or at least new to me: 

    Politspam (n): Using a spam engine for political purposes.

In this particular case, to get back at the University of Groningen.
The content suggests its more prank than vigilante activism (in the
old days we used to say "someone left their terminal unguarded")
but what's interesting is that it's not trying to sell me anything
or lead me to any for-fee service, it's just trying to spread
a meme that RUG is evil.

Has anyone else started to receive either consumer vigilante or
political activism messages via spam methods?
