Neat stuff. Seems to combine elements of Scientology/Xenu and

> M09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.
> DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on
> their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in
> Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked
> together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid
> derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.
> The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities
> with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a
> description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see
> them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but
> not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth
> even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a
> renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.
> The definitive work on dragons is "The Flight of Dragons" by Peter
> Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long
> bow. Targets do not come much bigger.
> 
> Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that
> there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard
> their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They
> survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.
> They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet
> (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves
> but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.
> 
> Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the
> dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also
> to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote
> viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are
> contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be
> encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and
> mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help
> so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great
> difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove
> all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of
> Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus
> if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of
> all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their
> psi.
> 
> THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to
> hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.
> 
> Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of
> rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young
> hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made
> them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to
> keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this
> they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an
> act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the
> ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and
> so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have
> become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.
> 
> Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep
> them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and
> only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend
> to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is
> primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not
> suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.
> Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,
> even if they are standing on ice.
> 
> Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act
> of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female
> can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird
> sitting on a nest.
> 
> Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,
> while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate
> all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.
> 
> If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then
> purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our
> religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,
> regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to
> concentrate on "How to Brainwash your Neighbour". Conscious thought has
> built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using
> "How to care for and protect one's young" as a foundation.
> 
> Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something "A load of
> dinosaur's eggs". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity
> tends to purge all malice back to its roots.
> 
> It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,
> aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on

> 
> ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take
> control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the

> 
> Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.
> Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing

> Mind machines.
> The original engraving or engram.
> GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T

> TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of

> My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.

> Every extinct race, etc.
> BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via
