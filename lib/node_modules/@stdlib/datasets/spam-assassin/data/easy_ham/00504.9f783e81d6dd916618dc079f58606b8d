The military already have these spy satellites; they are basically
Hubble pointed the other way, so I doubt they will be a big enough
customer of this service to justify a next-generation wireless
network rollout for the rest of us.

My car is only just over 1.5 meters across and maybe 3 meters long, so
that means roughly six pixels total surface area.  You might find a
16-wheeler this way, but how often do people misplace a 16-wheeler
such that it is _that_ important to get old images of the terrain?
Since they can't send up aircraft to update images in realtime every
time, how is this different from just releasing the map on DVDs?  Why
wireless?

I thought of the common problem of lost prize cattle, but there again,
will there really be business-case for creating a hi-res map of
wyoming on the fly instead of just doing what they do now and hiring a
helicopter for a few hours?

I can see lower-res being useful for Geologists, but considering their
points of interest change only a few times every few million years,
there's not much need to be wireless based on up-to-the-minute data.
I expect most geologists travel with a laptop perfectly capable of DVD
playback, and I also expect the most interesting geology is in regions
where the wireless ain't going to go ;)

I don't mean to nit-pick, it's just that I'm curious as to (a) the
need for this product that justifies the extreme cost and (b) how we'd
justify the ubiquitous next-generation wireless network that this
product postulates when we /still/ can't find the killer app for 3G.
