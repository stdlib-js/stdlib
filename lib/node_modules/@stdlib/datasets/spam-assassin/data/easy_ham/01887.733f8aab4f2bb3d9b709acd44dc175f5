I've put up a page called "12 Reasons to Pre-Order Down and Out in the Magic 
Kingdom," with blurbs by twelve people telling you why they think you should 
buy it. Here're the blurbers:  

-  Bruce Sterling 
-  Lawrence Lessig 
-  Kelly Link 
-  Mark Frauenfelder 
-  Karl Schroeder 
-  Rudy Rucker 
-  Howard Rheingold 
-  Douglas Rushkoff 
-  Tim O'Reilly 
-  Bruce Schneier 
-  Gardner Dozois 
-  Mitch Kapor 

And the blurbs are great, like this one: 

    Wow! Disney imagineering meets nanotechnology, the reputation economy, and 
    Ray Kurzweil's transhuman future. As much fun as Neal Stephenson's Snow 
    Crash, and as packed with mind bending ideas about social changes cascading 
    from the frontiers of science.

(_NB: This used to be 13 reasons, but I just realized that I somehow ended up 
with a phantom entry from Dan GIllmor, who, on closer examination, it appears I 
failed to deliver a copy to, like a total idiot. My apologies, Dan_) Link[1]
