Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?
Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic
is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not
really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.
