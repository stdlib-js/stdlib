Point is, you're not likely to extrapolate much.  I could probably
find one hetero who had just as much sex.   Does that mean we're all
rampant hos?  No.

Listen.  If you pull numbers like that without a fact, the automagic
assumption is yes, they were extracted out of your neither orifice.
Point wasn't to conclude otherwise unless you had any relevant bits.
Its not my job to do _your_ bit searching for you, but I figured I'd
humor fork with this bit of finding:

averages of about 13 for every 3 months (for gay men), which totals to
about  52 a year.  52 a year doesn't equal 3000.   Or even 300.

WTF do my shitty math skillz have to do with girls and
hyperpromiscuity?  I was speaking -generally- meaning that guys and
girls probably have better things to do than boink everything they
see.  As above, I am assuming you're pulling things out of your ass, I
just felt like calling you on it.

BTW, there's nothing wrong with calling someone on a silly idea.  Its
allowed, and its generally not considered ad hominem, but the
homophobia statement might be.

Many times.  Which is why I said 'assuming that large ... (The meccas
dont count).  SF is a mecca in this example.  I obviously wasn't
clear, tho one could assume I wasn't talking about Medina.

EL> This doesn't happen because it couldn't happen. No one would want to.

doesn't happen?  true.   Couldn't happen?  who knows.   It has nothing
to do with how I 'feel' and everything to do with the fact that people
do concern themselves with more than just sex (otherwise I think we'd
see a helluva lot more of sex, and a helluva lot less of everything
else).

Well my suggestion is, if you can't take the responses, don't post
flamebait.
