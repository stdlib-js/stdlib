Don't worry too much : The day the server gets too busy, I'll cleanup and
publish the addresses of some mirrors, as many ftp mirrors exist (I'm aware
of at least 15), and even an apt one :-)
For now, the limit is far enough : When I unlocked the Psyche ISO images on
Monday, the bandwidth usage on the current (ftp|http|rsync) freshrpms.net
server went up to 90Mbps sustained, which is not bad as the server has a
100Mbps physical NIC! Of course, I'd get in trouble if it was always like
that, but the average used when no new Red Hat release is there is between
2 and 4Mbps, which my company tolerates, as I've convinced them it's a
useful return to the community providing us the great operating system all
our servers are running ;-)
