Razor folks: is -lm documented anywhere?   BTW, I notice all my *.conf
files in ~/.razor use "lm = 4" by default anyway.

Yeah, that'd be cool -- much appreciated!   comparing text classifiers
like spam filters, without tracking FPs, is not good.   After all, "cat >
/dev/null" gets a 100% hit rate, but without the FP rate figure of, let's
say 90%, you'd never know it was a bad thing to do ;)
