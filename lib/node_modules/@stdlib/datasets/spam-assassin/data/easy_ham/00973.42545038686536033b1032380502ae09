2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 -
byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in
its parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment where
Tcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a "pattern - body"
strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find
a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  The
subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you
the exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsing
correctly, and was arguably wrong before.

2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support in
exmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on
exmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.
