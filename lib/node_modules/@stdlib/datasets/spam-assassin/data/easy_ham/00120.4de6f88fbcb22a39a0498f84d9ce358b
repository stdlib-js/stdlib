In 1993 or so, when I was a student in Edinburgh, I had a bad dream about
being chased around a house by a scary murderous tramp who was carrying a
bag full of half-penny coins (which had long since ceased to be legal
tender). The next morning as I left the flat, I found a half-penny on the
doormat right outside our door. Fair gave me the willies, that did.
