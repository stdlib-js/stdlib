Anyone have a copy of Bell Centennial I can borrow? I wonder if I'll ever have 
$100 to spend on fonts. (Matthew Carter, I'd be happy to pay you the two cents 
in royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of fonts.) 

*Update:* Kevin Marks[1], who is stupendously incredible for far more things 
than I can list here points out that Gill Sans (which I was asking for earlier) 
is _included with OS X_. I knew Mac OS X included a lot of great fonts[2], but 
I don't know how I overlooked this. _Awesome!_

First ammendement beer bash. 

iSync Beta[4] (guess they learned a lesson from iCal) is out.
