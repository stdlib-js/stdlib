Movable Type 2.5 is out. I'm running it and it appears to work. It incorporates 
many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
sort of way. 

The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
"TemplateDir" to "SearchTemplatePath", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change "AltTemplate1", "AltTemplate2", "AltTemplate3", etc. to "AltTemplate". 
They should all just be "AltTemplate".
