And yet STILL noone is out there creating _public domain_ content. Is there
even one person out there can can even begin to talk without being a
complete hypocrite? And no the "open source" people cant talk either, the
GPL aint even close. I know I cant talk.

If the creator didnt say you could have it without paying, it's theft, so
simple, hell that's even in all the major holy books.

Fair use needs to be clarified a bit and then I hope they start locking
people up. How else do i ever have hope of finding a job working for someone
that makes things people are supposed to ... *drumroll* pay for.
