Hi everybody !

My name is Gilles, I'm 19 and I'm french. My english is very bad and I'm sorry 
if you do not understand correctly my emails. 

I use Linux since 3 months. Before I worked with Windows 2000 Pro. I enjoy Red 
Hat... I tried Mandrake, SuSE, Debian, Slackware and my favorite of all of 
them is Red Hat. 

Actually I use Red Hat 7.3.

I visited the web site Freshrpms, I congratulated Thias for his work.

And I subscribed to this list for to know more about Red Hat and RPMs' news.

Pleased to read U soon.
Gilles (Nice, South of France)
