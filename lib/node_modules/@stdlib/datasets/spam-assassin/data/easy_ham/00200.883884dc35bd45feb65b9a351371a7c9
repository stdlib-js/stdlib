Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and
did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).

However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby:

http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html

whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea.  You
could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and
mount the fat32 partition.

Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the
maptop far more useful in the long run.
