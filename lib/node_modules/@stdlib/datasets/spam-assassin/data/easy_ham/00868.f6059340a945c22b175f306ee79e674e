Well it looks pretty much 99% sure that we will be moving in on Nov 1 to
the new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of
dieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the
next few weeks..

In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core
for the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless
ap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop

I made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the
card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether
hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some
more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)
but all in all a smooth move.


Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of
funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,
essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get
goofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between
the AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting
11mbs and at least 60% goodness.


Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works
inthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a
microwave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear
cat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad
thing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I
hope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )

Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed
by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is
heading this way....DUCKKKKK
