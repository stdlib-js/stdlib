Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow - it is fast.  Comes with some lovely client tools
also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single
developer license downloadable from their website.
