Just one. Not everybody does that. Most of them are now dead, anyway.

Yes. Notice that I've specifically excluded sex industry. That be 
cheating.

Ain't done no hypothesizing. Anecdotal evidence'R'Us. Couldn't you just
Google, or something?

Yeah, I'm a gay Jew Nazi Muslim who's also a lead character on Kaz's
underworld. Can we go on with the programme now?

Which was my point. Gurls don't do hyperpromiscuity as a life style. It's

Yeah, I think it could be also difficult finding a gay bathhouse in Thule,
Greenland. Or parts of central Africa. To think of it, both Oort and 
Kuiper belts are utterly devoid of gay people as well. Isn't this 
remarkable?

This doesn't happen because it couldn't happen. No one would want to. 
Because you feel that way. Correct?

I didn't expect so much reflexive knee-jerking on this list.
