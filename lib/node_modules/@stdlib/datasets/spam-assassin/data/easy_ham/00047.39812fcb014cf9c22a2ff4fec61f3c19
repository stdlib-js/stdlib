It will function as a router if that is what you wish.

It even looks like the modem's embedded OS is some kind of linux, being that
it has interesting interfaces like eth0.

I don't use it as a router though.... I just have it do the absolute minimum
DSL stuff and do all the really fun stuff like pppoe on my linux box........

Also the manual tells you what the default password is.

Don't forget to run pppoe over the alcatel speedtouch 350i as in my case you
'HAVE TO' have a bridge configured in the router/modem's software........
This lists your VCI values etc.
