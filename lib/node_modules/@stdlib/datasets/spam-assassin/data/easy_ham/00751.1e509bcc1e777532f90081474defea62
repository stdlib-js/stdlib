In a very real sense we are still playing the "stone hurst man, man wears
hide, stone dont hurt no more so now we use arrows, arrows go thru hide
dang lets try this chain mail stuff, arrows dont go thru chain mail so now
we try crafting long spears with chain ripping heads, hey there buddy try
that against my plate mail, well F you and the horse you plated try doging
a bullets, holy shit where is my kevlar, does you kevlar stop nukes..."
game.

In this mad mad mad mad james burkian cum chucky darwin world there is no
rest for either the wicked or the nonwicked, there is just the ramp up to
the Brand New Jimmiez.

the trick I think should all be learning is not so much looking for the
THE KILLER APP but instead to look for the "really cool app that mutates
to meet changes"

Bascialy give china no choise but to shoot its own head off to stop the
music.

bang bang ... have a nice day.
