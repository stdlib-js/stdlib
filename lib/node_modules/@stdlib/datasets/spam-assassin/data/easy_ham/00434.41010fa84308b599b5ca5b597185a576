A tonal countdown would be nice.

Hmm. Seems like every CD player should include the
capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
inserted. 

Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
first-track operation.

You could also take the CD out while it is "playing".

Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening. Kids would like that. "Play this," they'd
say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would
start immediately.
