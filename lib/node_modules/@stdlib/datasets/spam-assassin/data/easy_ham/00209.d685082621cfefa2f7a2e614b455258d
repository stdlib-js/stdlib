 Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5" to 3.5" IDE cable,
and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the
IDE cable too.

 Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.
