Feorag writes from Scotland: "You probably haven't heard of John Otway, but he 
has a small and devoted following here. He did a limited issue CD and asked his 
fans to vote on which track _they'd_ like to see as a single. The one they 
picked just entered the UK charts at number 9! Bet that'll piss off the major 
record labels, especially as the marketing budget was probably about zero. I 
might just watch Top of the Pops this week." Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, 
Feorag[3]!_)
