Hey,
I has just been given an old Toshiba CS100 with earliest pentium and 400mb
of HD but only a floppy drive on it, its got Win3.1 which is funny to see
again but gonna be cleared as soon as i stop messing with it. What I was
wondering was could anyone advise what O/S would be good for this, I want a
small usable *nix distro for it that i can transfer to it fom floppy.
Connecting this to Winblows>i know that winblows allows pier-to-pier
connections over serial and parellel ports to other winblows but is this
easy do for connecting winblows to *nix???
