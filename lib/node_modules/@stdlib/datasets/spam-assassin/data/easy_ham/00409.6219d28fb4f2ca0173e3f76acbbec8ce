and it looks like PPP for USD 33k is only
about USD 50k*, at least in Big Macs:

<http://www.economist.com/images/20020427/CFN751.gif>
Australia	 A$3.00 USD 1.62	-35%
US		  $2.49 USD 2.49
Switzerland	SFr6.30 USD 3.81	+53%

Interestingly enough, although housing in
Perth seems cheap, housing in Switzerland
doesn't seem to be as expensive as the Big
Macs would imply.

* which still doesn't sound bad, if one
can convert urban CA equity into free and
clear Oz ownership.
