I just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing.

_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, "That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape." 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by "Netscape employee" you really meant 
"Apple employee." and by "always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape" you meant "was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool." 

Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. 

MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. 

I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.

The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.

Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. 

Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say "you 
should do this" or "you should do that", they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says "We didn't like this, or we didn't like that.", 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.
