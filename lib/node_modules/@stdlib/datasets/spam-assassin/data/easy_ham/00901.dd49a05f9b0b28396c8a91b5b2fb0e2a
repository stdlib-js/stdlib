When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated
as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.

But you knew that.

When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in
rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.

I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there
aren't any.

If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or
death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves.  That won't stop
them or you from pretending otherwise.
