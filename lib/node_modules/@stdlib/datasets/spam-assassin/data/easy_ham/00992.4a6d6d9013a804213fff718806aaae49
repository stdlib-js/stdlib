It places the company, corporate network and data at risk.

Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more
being regularly found.  An exploited system, to whatever extent, places
other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company
reputation and liability with customers at risk, and
proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably
expected to use Outlook in a safe manner.  The net result is that
Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence
and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned.

I don't use custom sequences, so I can't comment well.  I suspect that
you'd have to use a cron job to maintain the sequences.

Nope.  I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis
SSH X11 forwarding).  In fact, your message was read and replied to
(this message) while at work, using an exmh instance running on my home
machine.
