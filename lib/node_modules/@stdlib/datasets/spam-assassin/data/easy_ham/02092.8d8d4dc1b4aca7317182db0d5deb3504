Slashdot's reporting that according to the current ish of Popular Science, an 
Easter Egg has been discovered in the transmission control software for the BMW 
M3: 

    ...the proper combination of commands to the electronically controlled 
    manual transmission will cause the car to rev up to 4000rpm and drop the 
    clutch... 

Are we sure that this is a feature and not a bug? Link[1] Discuss[2]
