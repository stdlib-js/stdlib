Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):

The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned
concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)

No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a
different licence, such as a proprietary ("closed" [sic]) licence.

The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't
contract law.

This isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this
subject.  I'm sure it won't be the last.
