Hello all,
Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback
that I got to my question today.  I have one more question though.  I
downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to
the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I
started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced
some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?

./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/
local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url
That worked fine so I moved to the next step.
make
At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:
Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el
make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'
make: *** [w3] Error 2

When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying
that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are
the commands I used.
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url
followed by the commands make and make install.
There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so
I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.

Thanks again

Darragh
