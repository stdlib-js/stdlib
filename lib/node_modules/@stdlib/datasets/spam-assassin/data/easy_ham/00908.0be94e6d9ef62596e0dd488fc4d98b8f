I'm not sure what you mean by "let's you and him fight", but it is 
important to remember that England was in control of Ireland
for 300 years, and that it was only thanks to the distraction of WW I 
that the south managed to gain its independence. If you mean
splitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups 
to opposite sides of the line, it also seems to have not worked in
India/Pakistan.
I suppose Canada, which is supposed to be a "loose confederation" of 2 
founding nations (French and English) can be cited as a success. The 
jury is still out, but so far only a few brief rebellions and 
referendums and such, still together after 130+ years.
