Right.  Because Americans are the only people capable of being
assholes.  Shit.  History keeps fucking up when they keep mentioning
all the historical examples of dickhead-ness that have proceeded the
US.

After all, we're the only country who gets unruly when it comes to
issues.   Thats why its always just the Americans at those crazy WTO
meetings...  Right, Owen?
