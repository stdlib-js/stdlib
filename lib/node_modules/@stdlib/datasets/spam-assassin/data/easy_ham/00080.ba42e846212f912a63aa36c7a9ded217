If I have any RPMS in

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/

that could be useful to some one with a real apt repository or someone who wants to
maintain a package, be it known I am not selfish :)

I found stuff I thought would later get popular so I would not have to maintain the
RPMs for them after they hit the big time. Gnump3d is an exapmple of this.

So if anyone is psyched, go for it. If so, let me know so I can get the RPMs from
you in the future.

That's "angle" as in geometry.
