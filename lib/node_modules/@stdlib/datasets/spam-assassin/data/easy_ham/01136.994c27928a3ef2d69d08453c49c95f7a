I haven't seen what you describe, but I just saw something close to what you 
describe.  I think the message that's being incorrectly highlighted as current
is related to the current message in the other folder rather than being n+1.

I'll have to investigate a bit more to identify and fix the bug, but there is 
something going on here.
