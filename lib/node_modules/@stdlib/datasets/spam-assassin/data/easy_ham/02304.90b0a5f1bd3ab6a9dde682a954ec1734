[IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/actlab.jpg] Jon Lebkowsky has posted a 
little gallery of pictures from my EFF-Austin talk at ACTLab at the University 
of Texas (and a couple shots from the kick-ass BBQ we ate beforehand, note the 
Atkins-compliant lunch). I had a fantastic time there -- thanks to the 
organizers and especially to Jon for putting it together. It's was especially 
great to meeet the Boing Boing readers who came out to the talk! Link[1]
