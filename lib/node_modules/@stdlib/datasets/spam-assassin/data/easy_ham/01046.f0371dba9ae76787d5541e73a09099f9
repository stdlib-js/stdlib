OK, I'll add this.

Requiring a file that isn't part of an rpm is not possible, no, except
maybe by stopping the build process if it isn't found... but that's errr...
ugly!
And I really think that for people who installed a kernel from sources, the
easiest is to install the alsa kernel drivers from source too...

This would be a tricky one since to use the "--with <name>" feature of
rpmbuild, I think you'd need to add individual handling of each and every
card :-/

That's what the "alsa-driver" is there for, create all the base files
excluding the kernel drivers. What I would suggest for dependency reasons
it to install an "alsa-kernel" for the original kernel (you've kept it,
right? ;-)) and install ALSA modules from source for custom kernels built
from source.

Indeed : The rpm 4.1 snapshot in (null) has a few new features among which
having the build fail when files are present in the build root but not
listed in the %files section. I should remove them manually as part of the
build process... or maybe the new "%exclude /path/to/file" in the %files
section would do, but I don't know how older versions of rpm would handle
it. On my (null) build system, I've simply set the variable :
%_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0
