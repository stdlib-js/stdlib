Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).

However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.

I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.

Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.

I hope this helps some.
