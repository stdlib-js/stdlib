For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or
java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.

I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's
dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,
written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important
IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an
option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.

Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of "oops,
there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop
around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,
rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best".

This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open source
knockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL'd libs ;)
