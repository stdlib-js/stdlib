    Returns the Palmer Penguins dataset as an alternative to the Iris dataset.

    The data consists of 17 attributes:

    - studyName: Sampling expedition from which data were collected.
    - sampleNumber: An integer denoting the continuous numbering sequence for 
    each sample.
    - species: A string denoting whether the observation belongs to an Adelie, 
    Chinstrap or a Gentoo Penguin.
    - region: A string denoting the region of Palmer LTER sampling grid.
    - island: Island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer 
    Archipelago (Antarctica).
    - stage: A string denoting reproductive stage at sampling.
    - individualID: A string denoting the unique ID for each individual in 
    dataset.
    - clutchCompletion: A boolean whether the study nest was observed with a 
    full clutch, i.e., 2 eggs.
    - dateEgg: The date when the study nest was observed with 1 egg.
    - culmenLength: The length of the dorsal ridge of a bird's bill 
    (millimeters).
    - culmenDepth: The depth of the dorsal ridge of a bird's bill 
    (millimeters).
    - flipperLength: The length penguin flipper (millimeters).
    - bodyMass: The penguin's body mass in grams.
    - sex: The sex of the penguin.
    - delta15N: The measure of the ratio of stable isotopes 15N:14N.
    - delta13C: The measure of the ratio of stable isotopes 13C:12C.
    - comments: Additional relevant information for the observation.

    The palmerpenguins data contains size measurements for three penguin 
    species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
    The dataset can be used to classify two dependent variables: 1) sex 
    and 2) species.
