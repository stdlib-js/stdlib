{{alias}}()
    Returns a dataset derived from information collected by the US Census
    Service concerning housing in Boston, Massachusetts (1978).

    The data consists of 14 attributes:

    - crim: per capita crime rate by town.
    - zn: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet.
    - indus: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
    - chas: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
    - nox: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
    - rm: average number of rooms per dwelling.
    - age: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
    - dis: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
    - rad: index of accessibility to radial highways.
    - tax: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
    - ptratio: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
    - b: 1000(Bk-0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
    - lstat: percent lower status of the population.
    - medv: median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.

    The dataset can be used to predict two dependent variables: 1) nitrous oxide
    level and 2) median home value.

    The median home value field seems to be censored at 50.00 (corresponding to
    a median value of $50,000). Censoring is suggested by the fact that the
    highest median value of exactly $50,000 is reported in 16 cases, while 15
    cases have values between $40,000 and $50,000. Values are rounded to the
    nearest hundred. Harrison and Rubinfeld do not, however, mention any
    censoring.

    Additionally, as documented by Gilley and Pace (1996), the dataset contains
    eight miscoded median values.
