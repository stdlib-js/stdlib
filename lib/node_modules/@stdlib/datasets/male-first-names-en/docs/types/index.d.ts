/**
* Returns a list of common male first names in English speaking countries.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   This function synchronously reads data from disk for each invocation. Such behavior is intentional and so is the avoidance of `require`. We assume that invocations are infrequent, and we want to avoid the `require` cache. This means that we allow data to be garbage collected and a user is responsible for explicitly caching data.
*
*
* @throws unable to read data
* @returns male first names
*
* @example
* var list = names();
* // returns [ 'Aaron', 'Ab', 'Abba', 'Abbe', 'Abbey', ... ]
