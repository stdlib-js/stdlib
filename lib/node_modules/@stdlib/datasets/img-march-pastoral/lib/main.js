/**
* Returns an image of sheep in a pastoral setting.

* ## Notes
*
* -   This function synchronously reads data from disk for each invocation. Such behavior is intentional and so is the avoidance of `require`. We assume that invocations are infrequent, and we want to avoid the `require` cache. This means that we allow data to be garbage collected and a user is responsible for explicitly caching data.
*
* @throws {Error} unable to read data
* @returns {Buffer} image
*
* @example
* var img = image();
* // returns <Buffer>
