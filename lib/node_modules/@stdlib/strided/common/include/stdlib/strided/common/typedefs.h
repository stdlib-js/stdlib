// TODO: why are these functions needed? And how would they be used? When would we be concerned with casting for strided array functions? I suppose if provided doubles and "unsafe" casting is allowed, then we could cast double-precision output to `float32` if provided a `float32` output array. Or, if only "same_kind" casts are allowed, then if provided integer arrays, would not be able to invoke a callback which expects doubles. It seems to me that casting is more applicable outside of element-wise interfaces (e.g., when have two arrays of different types and need to figure out a common type for performing operations and for saving the results). ...Another use case is suppose I provide two `float32` arrays, but my add-on does not have a function with a corresponding type signature. Based on `casting`, we could try to find a "cast-compatible" interface (e.g., an interface which accepts `float64` arrays). I suppose the benefit here is, rather than have to spell out individual interfaces, we could provide a few known and then let casting rules handle "unknown" argument types. For type resolution in NumPy, see <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/7e9d603664edc756f555fecf8649bf888a46d47c/numpy/core/src/umath/ufunc_type_resolution.c>.
