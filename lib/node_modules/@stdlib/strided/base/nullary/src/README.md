# Nullary

> Strided array functions for nullary callbacks.

## Notes

-   Each file contains a single strided array function. The file name matches the strided array function name suffix.
-   The implemented functions which perform conversions are **not** exhaustive and that is intentional. Namely, most functions which would perform "unsafe" return value conversions are not included (e.g., converting a `double` to `int32`). If users want to perform "unsafe" conversions, that should be a conscious decision. All the machinery (e.g., macros, typedefs, etc) is available for implementing strided array functions which perform "unsafe" conversions, but we should not make this overly easy or be proactive in promoting "unsafe" conversion use.
