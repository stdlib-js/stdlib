## Usage

```javascript
var Symbol = require( '@stdlib/symbol/ctor' );
```

#### Symbol( \[description] )

Returns a [`Symbol`][mdn-symbol] primitive.

<!-- run-disable -->

<!-- eslint-disable symbol-description -->

```javascript
var s = Symbol();
// returns <symbol>
```

To aid debugging, provide a [symbol][mdn-symbol] `description`.

<!-- run-disable -->

```javascript
var s = Symbol( 'beep' );
// returns <symbol>
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   Unlike conventional constructors, the function does **not** support the `new` keyword.
-   The function is only supported in environments which support [symbols][mdn-symbol]. In non-supporting environments, the value is `undefined`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var hasSymbolSupport = require( '@stdlib/assert/has-symbol-support' );
var Symbol = require( '@stdlib/symbol/ctor' );

var s;

if ( hasSymbolSupport() ) {
    s = Symbol( 'beep' );

    // Print the value type:
    console.log( typeof s );
    // => 'symbol'

    // Serialize the symbol as a string:
    console.log( s.toString() );
    // => 'Symbol(beep)'

    // Test symbol equality:
    console.log( s === Symbol( 'beep' ) );
    // => false
} else {
    console.log( 'Environment does not support symbols.' );
}
