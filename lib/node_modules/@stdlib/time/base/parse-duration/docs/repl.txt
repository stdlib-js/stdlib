{{alias}}( str )
    Parses a duration string into an object.

    A duration string is a string containing a sequence of time units. A time
    unit is a nonnegative integer followed by a unit identifier. The following
    unit identifiers are supported:

    - d: days.
    - h: hours.
    - m: minutes.
    - s: seconds.
    - ms: milliseconds.

    Duration strings are case insensitive. For example, the string `1M3S10MS` is
    equivalent to `1m3s10ms`.

    If a duration string does not contain a time unit, the respective property
    is set to 0.

    An empty string is considered a valid duration string and is parsed as
    `0d0h0m0s0ms`.
