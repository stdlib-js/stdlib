<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var tic = require( '@stdlib/time/tic' );
```

#### tic()

Returns a high-resolution time.

```javascript
var t = tic();
// returns [<number>,<number>]
```

The returned `array` has the following format: `[seconds, nanoseconds]`.

<secton class="notes">

## Notes

-   In browser environments, the implementation uses the [`performance.now`][performance-now] API. If the [`performance-now`][performance-now] API is unavailable, the implementation falls back to the [`Date`][date] object.
-   In non-browser environments, the implementation uses [`process.hrtime`][process-hrtime].

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var tic = require( '@stdlib/time/tic' );
var toc = require( '@stdlib/time/toc' );

var start = tic();

setTimeout( onTimeout, 2000 );

function onTimeout() {
    var elapsed = toc( start );
    console.log( 'Elapsed: %d seconds and %d nanoseconds', elapsed[0], elapsed[1] );
}
