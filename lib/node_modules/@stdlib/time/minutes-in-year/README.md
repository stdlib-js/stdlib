# minutesInYear

> Determine the number of minutes in a year according to the [Gregorian calendar][gregorian-calendar].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var minutesInYear = require( '@stdlib/time/minutes-in-year' );
```

#### minutesInYear( \[value] )

Returns the number of minutes in a year according to the [Gregorian calendar][gregorian-calendar].

```javascript
var num = minutesInYear();
// returns <number>

By default, the function returns the number of minutes in the current year (according to local time). To determine the number of minutes for a particular year, provide either a year or a [`Date`][date-object] object.

```javascript
var num = minutesInYear( new Date() );
// returns <number>

num = minutesInYear( 2000 );
// returns 527040

num = minutesInYear( 2017 );
// returns 525600
```
