# hoursInYear

> Determine the number of hours in a year according to the [Gregorian calendar][gregorian-calendar].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var hoursInYear = require( '@stdlib/time/hours-in-year' );
```

#### hoursInYear( \[value] )

Returns the number of hours in a year according to the [Gregorian calendar][gregorian-calendar].

```javascript
var num = hoursInYear();
// returns <number>
```

By default, the function returns the number of hours in the current year (according to local time). To determine the number of hours for a particular year, provide either a year or a [`Date`][date-object] object.

```javascript
var num = hoursInYear( new Date() );
// returns <number>

num = hoursInYear( 2000 );
// returns 8784

num = hoursInYear( 2017 );
// returns 8760
```
