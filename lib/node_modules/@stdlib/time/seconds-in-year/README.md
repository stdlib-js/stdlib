# secondsInYear

> Determine the number of seconds in a year according to the [Gregorian calendar][gregorian-calendar].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var secondsInYear = require( '@stdlib/time/seconds-in-year' );
```

#### secondsInYear( \[value] )

Returns the number of seconds in a year according to the [Gregorian calendar][gregorian-calendar].

```javascript
var num = secondsInYear();
// returns <number>
```

By default, the function returns the number of seconds in the current year (according to local time). To determine the number of seconds for a particular year, provide either a year or a [`Date`][date-object] object.

```javascript
var num = secondsInYear( new Date() );
// returns <number>

num = secondsInYear( 2000 );
// returns 31622400

num = secondsInYear( 2017 );
// returns 31536000
```
