{{alias}}( [month[, year]] )
    Returns the number of minutes in a month.

    By default, the function returns the number of minutes in the current month
    of the current year (according to local time). To determine the number of
    minutes for a particular month and year, provide `month` and `year`
    arguments.

    A `month` may be either a month's integer value, three letter abbreviation,
    or full name (case insensitive).

    The function's return value is a generalization and does **not** take into
    account inaccuracies due to daylight savings conventions, crossing
    timezones, or other complications with time and dates.

    month: string|Date|integer (optional)

    year: integer (optional)
        Year.

    Returns

    out: integer
        Minutes in a month.
