{{alias}}( a, b )
    Multiplies two signed 32-bit integers and returns an array of two signed 32-
    bit integers which represents the signed 64-bit integer product.

    When computing the product of 32-bit integer values in double-precision
    floating-point format (the default JavaScript numeric data type), computing
    the double word product is necessary in order to avoid exceeding the maximum
    safe double-precision floating-point integer value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a: integer
        Signed 32-bit integer.

    b: integer
        Signed 32-bit integer.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<number>
        Double word product (in big endian order; i.e., the first element
        corresponds to the most significant bits and the second element to the
        least significant bits).

    Examples
    --------
    > var v = {{alias}}( 1, 10 )
    [ 0, 10 ]


{{alias}}.assign( a, b, out, stride, offset )
    Multiplies two signed 32-bit integers and assigns results representing the
    signed 64-bit integer product to a provided output array.

    When computing the product of 32-bit integer values in double-precision
    floating-point format (the default JavaScript numeric data type), computing
    the double word product is necessary in order to avoid exceeding the maximum
    safe double-precision floating-point integer value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a: integer
        Signed 32-bit integer.

    b: integer
        Signed 32-bit integer.

    out: Array|TypedArray|Object
        Output array.

    stride: integer
        Output array stride.

    offset: integer
        Output array index offset.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array|TypedArray|Object
        Double word product (in big endian order; i.e., the first element
        corresponds to the most significant bits and the second element to the
        least significant bits).

    Examples
    --------
    > var out = [ 0, 0 ];
    > var v = {{alias}}.assign( 1, 10, out, 1, 0 )
    [ 0, 10 ]
    > var bool = ( v === out )
    true
