/**
* Simultaneously computes the Jacobi elliptic functions sn, cn, and dn, and am.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Values are computed using the arithmetic-geometric from Abramowitz and Stegun 16.4.
* -   When m < 0 or m > 1, `sn`, `cn`, and `dn` are computed in terms of elliptic functions with 0 < m < 1 using the transformations from Abramowitz and Stegun 16.10 and 16.11, respectively. Thus the domain of m is any real number. When m < 0 or m > 1, `am` is not computed and will be returned as NaN.
* -   Values for small m (m < SQRT_EPS) are computed using the approximations of Abramowitz and Stegun 16.13. For each evaluation, the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, K(m), is computed in order to reduce the period and ensure valid output for all u.
* -   Values for m near unity (m > 1 - SQRT_EPS) are computed using the approximations of Abramowitz and Stegun 16.15. For each evaluation, the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, K(m), is computed in order to reduce the period and ensure valid output for all u.
*
* @param {number} u - input value
* @param {number} m - modulus `m`, equivalent to `kÂ²`
* @returns {Array<number>} sn, cn, dn, and Jacobi amplitude am
*
* @example
* var v = ellipj( 0.3, 0.5 );
* // returns [ ~0.293, ~0.956, ~0.978, ~0.298 ]
*
* @example
* v = ellipj( 0.0, 0.0 );
* // returns [ ~0.0, ~1.0, ~1.0, ~0.0 ]
*
* @example
* v = ellipj( Infinity, 1.0 );
* // returns [ ~1.0, ~0.0, ~0.0, ~1.571 ]
*
* @example
* v = ellipj( 0.0, -2.0 );
* // returns [ ~0.0, ~1.0, ~1.0, NaN ]
*
* @example
* v = ellipj( NaN, NaN );
* // returns [ NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN ]
