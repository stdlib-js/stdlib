    gen( domain, name )

Generate fixture data and write to file.

# Arguments

* `domain`: domain
* `name::AbstractString`: output filename

# Examples

``` julia
julia> x = range( -1000.0, stop = 1000.0, length = 2001 );
julia> gen( x, \"data.json\" );
```

	# Based on the script directory, create an output filepath:

	# Write the data to the output filepath as JSON:
