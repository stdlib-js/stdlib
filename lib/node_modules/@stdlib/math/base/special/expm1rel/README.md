## Usage

```javascript
var expm1 = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/expm1rel' );
```

#### expm1rel( x )

Computes the relative error exponential.

```javascript
var v = expm1rel( 0.0 );
// returns 1.0
```

## Notes

-   When `x` is near zero, `exp(x)-1` can suffer catastrophic cancellation (i.e., a significant loss in precision). `expm1rel` avoids such a loss in precision.
