# factorial2

> [Double factorial][double-factorial] function.

<section class="intro">

The [double factorial][double-factorial] of a number `n`, denoted `n!!`, is defined as the product of all the positive integers up to `n` that have the same parity (odd or even) as `n`.

Thus, for example, `5!!` is `5 * 3 * 1 = 15` and `8!!` is `8 * 6 * 4 * 2 = 384`.

## Usage

```javascript
var factorial2 = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/factorial2' );
```

#### factorial2( n )

Evaluates the [double factorial][double-factorial] of `n`.

```javascript
var v = factorial2( 2 );
// returns 2

v = factorial2( 3 );
// returns 3

v = factorial2( 0 );
// returns 1

v = factorial2( 4 );
// returns 8

v = factorial2( 5 );
// returns 15

v = factorial2( NaN );
// returns NaN

v = factorial2( 301 );
// returns Infinity
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var oneTo = require( '@stdlib/array/base/one-to' );
var factorial2 = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/factorial2' );

var values = oneTo( 300 );

var i;
for ( i = 0; i < values.length; i++ ) {
    console.log( 'f(%d): %d', values[ i ], factorial2( values[ i ] ) );
}
