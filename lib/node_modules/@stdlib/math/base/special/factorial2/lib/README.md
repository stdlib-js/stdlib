# Double factorial

> Compute the [double factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial) 
of a non-negative integer

The [double factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial) 
of a number n, denoted n!!, is defined as the product of all the 
positive integers up to n that have the same parity (odd or even) as n.  

Thus, for example, 5!! is 5 * 3 * 1 = 15; and 8!! is 8 * 6 * 4 * 2 = 384.  

## Usage

    var dfact = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/factorial2' );

#### factorial2( x )

Computes the [double factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial)
of a non-negative integer.

    var v = factorial2( 2 );
    // returns 2

    v = factorial2( 3 );
    // returns 3

    v = factorial2( 0 );
    // returns 1

    v = factorial2( 4 );
    // returns 8

    v = factorial2( 5 );
    // returns 15

## Examples

	var factorial2 = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/factorial2' );


	for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
   	 f2 = factorial2(i);
   	 console.log( 'factorial2(%d) = %d', i, f2 );
	}
