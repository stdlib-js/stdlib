    gen( x, filepath )

Generate fixture data and write to file.

# Arguments

* `x`: domain
* `filepath::AbstractString`: filepath of the output file

# Examples

``` julia
julia> x = range( 0, stop = 1000, length = 2001 );
julia> gen( x, \"./data.json\" );
```

		("x", x),
		("expected", y)

# Get the filename:

# Extract the directory in which this file resides:

# Generate fixture data for decimal values:
