{{alias}}( z )
    Computes the argument of a double-precision complex floating-point number
    in radians.

    The argument of a complex number, also known as the phase, is the angle of
    the radius extending from the origin to the complex number plotted in the
    complex plane and the positive real axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z: Complex128
        Complex number.

    Returns
    -------
    phi: number
        Argument.

    Examples
    --------
    > var phi = {{alias}}( new {{alias:@stdlib/complex/float64}}( 5.0, 3.0 ) )
    ~0.5404
