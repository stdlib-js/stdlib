/**
* Evaluates a rational function, i.e., the ratio of two polynomials described by the coefficients stored in \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\).
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Coefficients should be sorted in ascending degree.
* -   The implementation uses [Horner's rule][horners-method] for efficient computation.
*
* [horners-method]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method

* @private
* @param {number} x - value at which to evaluate the rational function
* @returns {number} evaluated rational function
