    gen( re, im, name )

Generate fixture data and write to file.

# Arguments

* `re`: real components
* `im`: imaginary components
* `name::AbstractString`: output filename

# Examples

``` julia
julia> re = rand( 1000 );
julia> im = rand( 1000 );
julia> gen( re, im, \"data.json\" );
```

		cisre[ i ] = real( z );
		cisim[ i ] = imag( z );

	# Store data to be written to file as a collection:

		("cisim", cisim),

	# Based on the script directory, create an output filepath:

	# Write the data to the output filepath as JSON:
	outfile = open( filepath, "w" );
	write( outfile, JSON.json(data) );
	close( outfile );

# Get the filename:
file = @__FILE__;

# Extract the directory in which this file resides:

# Pure nonnegative real
