/**
* Computes `log(1+f) - f` for `1+f` in `~[sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)]`.
*
* ## Method
*
* This function is a helper function for computing logarithms in base \\(e\\), and what follows describes the overall strategy for doing so. The argument reduction and adding the final term of the polynomial are done by the caller for increased accuracy when different bases are used.
*
* 1.  Argument Reduction. Find \\(k\\) and \\(f\\) such that
*
*     ```tex
*     x = 2^k \cdot (1+f)
*     ```
*
*     where \\(\sqrt(2)/2 < 1+f < \sqrt(2)\\).
*
* 2.  Approximation of \\(\operatorname{log}(1+f)\\). Let
*
*     ```tex
*     \begin{align*}
*     s &= \frac{f}{2+f} \\
*     &= 2s + \frac{2}{3} s^3 + \frac{2}{5} s^5 + \ldots \\
*     &= 2s + s R
*     \end{align*}
*     ```
*
*     based on
*
*     ```tex
*     \operatorname{log}(1+f) &= \operatorname{log}(1+s) - \operatorname{log}(1-s)
*     ```
*
*     We use a special Reme algorithm on \\(\[0,0.1716]\\) to generate a polynomial of degree \\(14\\) to approximate \\(R\\). The maximum error of this polynomial approximation is bounded by \\(2^{-58.45}\\). In other words,
*
*     ```tex
*     R(z) ~ L_{g1} s^2 + L_{g2} s^4 + L_{g3} s^6 + L_{g4} s^8 + L_{g5} s^{10}  + L_{g6} s^{12}  + L_{g7} s^{14}
*     ```
*
*     where the values of \\(L_{g1}\\) to \\(L_{g7}\\) are the polynomial coefficients used in the program below and
*
*     ```tex
*     L_{g1} s^2 + \ldots + L_{g7} s^{14} - R(z) \leq 2^{-58.45}
*     ```
*
*     Note that
*
*     ```tex
*     2s = f - s \cdot f = f - h_{fsq} + (s \cdot h_{fsq})
*     ```
*
*     where \\(h_{fsq} = f^{2}/2\\).
*
*     In order to guarantee an error in \\(\operatorname{log}\\) below 1 ulp, we compute \\(\operatorname{log}\\) by
*
*     ```tex
*     \begin{align*}
*     \operatorname{log}(1+f) &= f - s (f - R) & \textrm{(if f is not too large)} \\
*     \operatorname{log}(1+f) &= f - (h_{fsq} - s (h_{fsq}+R)) & \textrm{(better accuracy)}
*     \end{align*}
*
* 3.  Finally,
*
*     ```tex
*     \begin{align*}
*     \operatorname{log}(x) &= k \cdot \operatorname{ln2} + \operatorname{log}(1+f) \\
*     &= k \cdot \operatorname{ln2}_{hi} + (f-(h_{fsq}-(s \cdot (h_{fsq}+R) + k \cdot \operatorname{ln2}_{lo})))
*     \end{align*}
*     ```
*
*     Here, \\(\operatorname{ln2}\\) is split into two floating point numbers:
*
*     ```tex
*     \operatorname{ln2} = \operatorname{ln2}_{hi} + \operatorname{ln2}_{lo}
*     ```
*
*     where \\(n \cdot \operatorname{ln2}_{hi}\\) is always exact for \\(|n| < 2000\\).
*
* @param f    input value
* @return     output value
*
* @example
* double out = stdlib_base_kernel_log1p( 1.0 );
* // returns ~0.1931
*/
double stdlib_base_kernel_log1p( const double f ) {
	double hfsq;
	double t1;
	double t2;
	double R;
	double s;
	double z;
