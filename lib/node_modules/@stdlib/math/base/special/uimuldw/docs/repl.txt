{{alias}}( [out,] a, b )
    Multiplies two unsigned 32-bit integers and returns an array of two unsigned
    32-bit integers which represents the 64-bit unsigned integer product.

    When computing the product of 32-bit integer values in double-precision
    floating-point format (the default JavaScript numeric data type), computing
    the double word product is necessary in order to avoid exceeding the maximum
    safe double-precision floating-point integer value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    out: ArrayLikeObject (optional)
        The output array.

    a: integer
        Unsigned 32-bit integer.

    b: integer
        Unsigned 32-bit integer.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ArrayLikeObject
        Double word product (in big endian order; i.e., the first element
        corresponds to the most significant bits and the second element to the
        least significant bits).

    Examples
    --------
    > var v = {{alias}}( 1, 10 )
    [ 0, 10 ]
