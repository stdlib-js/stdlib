    gen( domain, name )

Generate fixture data and write to file.

# Arguments

* `domain`: domain
* `name::AbstractString`: output filename

# Examples

``` julia
julia> x = range( -1000, stop = 1000, length = 2022 );
julia> gen( x, \"data.json\" );
```

	data = Dict([
		("x", x),
		("expected", y)
	]);

	# Based on the script directory, create an output filepath:
	filepath = joinpath( dir, name );

	# Write the data to the output filepath as JSON:
	outfile = open( filepath, "w" );
	write( outfile, JSON.json(data) );
