    gen( re, im, name )

Generate fixture data and write to file.

# Arguments

* `re`: real components
* `im`: imaginary components
* `name::AbstractString`: output filename

# Examples

``` julia
julia> re = rand( 1000 );
julia> im = rand( 1000 );
julia> gen( re, im, \"data.json\" );
```

	for i in eachindex( re )
		z = exp( Complex128( re[i], im[i] ) );
		expre[ i ] = real( z );
		expim[ i ] = imag( z );
	end

	# Store data to be written to file as a collection:
	data = Dict([
		("re", re),
		("im", im),
		("expre", expre),
		("expim", expim),
	]);

	# Based on the script directory, create an output filepath:
	filepath = joinpath( dir, name );

	# Write the data to the output filepath as JSON:
	outfile = open( filepath, "w" );
	write( outfile, JSON.json(data) );
	close( outfile );
end

# Get the filename:
file = @__FILE__;

# Extract the directory in which this file resides:
dir = dirname( file );

# Pure nonnegative imaginary:
re = zeros( 500 );
im = ( rand( 500 ) * 10000.0 ) - 5.0;
gen( re, im, "pure_imaginary.json" );

# General complex:
re = ( rand( 500 ) * 100.0 ) - 5.0;
im = ( rand( 500 ) * 100.0 ) - 5.0;
