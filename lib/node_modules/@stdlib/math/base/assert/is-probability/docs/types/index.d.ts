* Tests if a double-precision floating-point number is a probability.

*
* -   A probability is defined as a number on the closed interval `[0,1]`.
*
* @param x - value to test
* @returns boolean indicating whether the value is a probability
*
* @example
* var bool = isProbability( 0.5 );
* // returns true
*
* @example
* var bool = isProbability( 3.14 );
* // returns false
*
* @example
* var bool = isProbability( NaN );
* // returns false
