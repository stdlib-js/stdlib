{{alias}}( window )
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a moving
    statistical summary.

    The `window` parameter defines the number of values over which to compute
    the moving statistical summary.

    If provided a value, the accumulator function returns an updated moving
    statistical summary. If not provided a value, the accumulator function
    returns the current moving statistical summary.

    The returned summary is an object containing the following fields:

    - count: count.
    - max: maximum value.
    - min: minimum value.
    - range: range.
    - midrange: mid-range.
    - sum: sum.
    - mean: arithmetic mean.
    - variance: unbiased sample variance.
    - stdev: corrected sample standard deviation.

    The first `W-1` returned summaries will have less statistical support than
    subsequent summaries, as `W` values are needed to fill the window buffer.
    Until the window is full, the returned summary is computed from all provided
    values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window: integer
        Window size.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}( 3 );
    > var s = accumulator()
    {}
    > s = accumulator( 2.0 )
    {...}
    > s = accumulator( -5.0 )
    {...}
    > s = accumulator()
    {...}
