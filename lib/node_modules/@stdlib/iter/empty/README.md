<!-- Package usage documentation. -->

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var iterEmpty = require( '@stdlib/iter/empty' );
```

#### iterEmpty()

Returns an "empty" iterator (i.e., an iterator which never returns an iterated value).

```javascript
var it = iterEmpty();
// returns <Object>

var bool = it.next().done;
// returns true
```

The returned iterator protocol-compliant object has the following properties:

-   **next**: function which returns an iterator protocol-compliant object containing the next iterated value (if one exists) assigned to a `value` property and a `done` property having a `boolean` value indicating whether the iterator is finished.
-   **return**: function which closes an iterator and returns a single (optional) argument in an iterator protocol-compliant object.

## Notes

-   If an environment supports `Symbol.iterator`, the returned iterator is iterable.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var iterEmpty = require( '@stdlib/iter/empty' );

// Create an iterator:
var it = iterEmpty();

// Perform manual iteration...
var v;
while ( true ) {
    v = it.next();
    if ( v.done ) {
        console.log( 'done' );
        break;
    }
    // The following should never run...
    console.log( v.value );
}
```
