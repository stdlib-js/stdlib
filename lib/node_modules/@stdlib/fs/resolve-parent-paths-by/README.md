# resolveParentPathsBy

> Resolve paths from a set of paths according to a predicate function by walking parent directories.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var resolveParentPathsBy = require( '@stdlib/fs/resolve-parent-paths-by' );
```

<a name="resolve-parent-paths-by"></a>

#### resolveParentPathsBy( paths\[, options], predicate, clbk )

Asynchronously resolves paths from a set of paths according to a `predicate` function by walking parent directories.

```javascript
resolveParentPathsBy( [ 'package.json', 'package-lock.json' ], predicate, onPath );

function predicate( path, next ) {
    var bool = ( /\/test\//.test( path ) === false );
    next( null, bool );
}

function onPath( error, paths ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( paths );
    // e.g., => [...]
}
```

The function accepts the following `options`:

-   **dir**: base directory from which to begin walking. May be either an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory.

-   **mode**: mode of operation. The following modes are supported:

    -   `first`: return the first resolved path.
    -   `some`: return one or more paths resolved within the first directory level containing a match.
    -   `all`: return all resolved paths within the first directory level containing matches for all provided paths.
    -   `each`: independently return the first resolved path for each path at any directory level.
    
    Default: `'all'`.

By default, the function begins walking from the current working directory. To specify an alternative directory, set the `dir` option.

```javascript
var opts = {
    'dir': __dirname
};
resolveParentPathsBy( [ 'package.json' ], opts, predicate, onPath );

function predicate( path, next ) {
    var bool = ( /\/test\//.test( path ) === false );
    next( null, bool );
}

function onPath( error, paths ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( paths );
    // e.g., => [...]
}
```

When invoked, the `predicate` function is provided two arguments:

-   `path`: a resolved path.
-   `next`: a callback which should be called once the `predicate` function has finished processing a resolved path.

If a `predicate` function calls the `next` callback with a `truthy` second argument, the function proceeds to next function and returns the resolved path.

If unable to resolve paths, as per each mode function returns as following:

-   `first`: empty array.
-   `some`: empty array.
-   `all`: empty array.
-   `each`: Array<`null`>.

By default, the function requires that a directory contains matches for all provided paths before returning results. To specify an alternative operation mode, set the `mode` option.

```javascript
var opts = {
    'dir': __dirname,
    'mode': 'first'
};
resolveParentPathsBy( [ 'package.json', 'package-lock.json' ], opts, predicate, onPaths );

function predicate( path, next ) {
    var bool = ( /\/test\//.test( path ) === false );
    next( null, bool );
}

function onPaths( error, paths ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( paths );
    // => [...]
}
```

#### resolveParentPathsBy.sync( path\[, options], predicate )

Synchronously resolves paths from a set of paths according to a `predicate` function by walking parent directories.

```javascript
function predicate( path ) {
    return ( /\/test\//.test( path ) === false );
}

var path = resolveParentPathsBy.sync( [ 'package.json', 'README.md' ], predicate );
// e.g., returns [...]
```

## Notes

-   In `some` mode, the return order of asynchronously resolved paths is not guaranteed.
-   This implementation is **not** similar in functionality to core [`path.resolve`][node-core-path-resolve]. The latter performs string manipulation to generate a full path. This implementation walks parent directories to perform a **search**, thereby touching the file system. Accordingly, this implementation resolves a _real_ absolute file path and is intended for use when a target's location in a parent directory is unknown relative to a child directory; e.g., when wanting to find a package root from deep within a package directory.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/no-dynamic-require -->

```javascript
var resolveParentPathsBy = require( '@stdlib/fs/resolve-parent-paths-by' );

var opts = {
    'dir': __dirname
};

/* Sync */

function predicateSync( path ) {
    return true;
}

var out = resolveParentPathsBy.sync( [ 'package.json', 'README.md' ], opts, predicateSync );
// returns [...]

out = resolveParentPathsBy.sync( [ 'non_existent_basename/package.json' ], opts, predicateSync );
// => []

opts.mode = 'first';
out = resolveParentPathsBy.sync( [ 'non_existent_basename/package.json', 'package.json' ], opts, predicateSync );
// => returns [...]

/* Async */

function predicateAsync( path, next ) {
    setTimeout( onTimeout, 0 );

    function onTimeout() {
        next( null, true );
    }
}

function onPath( error, paths ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( paths );
}

resolveParentPathsBy( [ 'package.json', 'README.md' ], opts, predicateAsync, onPath );
resolveParentPathsBy( [ './../non_existent_path/package.json' ], predicateAsync, onPath );
```
