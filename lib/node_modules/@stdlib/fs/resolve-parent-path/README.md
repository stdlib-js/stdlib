# Resolve Parent Path

> Resolve a path by walking parent directories.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var resolveParentPath = require( '@stdlib/fs/resolve-parent-path' );
```

<a name="resolve-parent-path"></a>

#### resolveParentPath( path\[, options], clbk )

Asynchronously resolves a path by walking parent directories.

```javascript
resolveParentPath( 'package.json', onPath );

function onPath( error, path ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( path );
    // => '...'
}
```

The function accepts the following `options`:

-   **dir**: base directory from which to begin walking. May be either an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory.

By default, the function begins walking from the current working directory. To specify an alternative directory, set the `dir` option.

```javascript
var opts = {
    'dir': __dirname
};
resolveParentPath( 'package.json', opts, onPath );

function onPath( error, path ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( path );
    // => '...'
}
```

#### resolveParentPath.sync( path\[, options] )

Synchronously resolves a path by walking parent directories.

```javascript
var path = resolveParentPath.sync( 'package.json' );
// returns '...'
```

The function accepts the same `options` as [`resolveParentPath()`](#resolve-parent-path).

## Notes

-   If unable to resolve a path, both functions return `null`.
-   This implementation is **not** similar in functionality to core [`path.resolve`][node-core-path-resolve]. The latter performs string manipulation to generate a full path. This implementation walks parent directories to perform a **search**, thereby touching the file system. Accordingly, this implementation resolves a _real_ absolute file path and is intended for use when a target's location in a parent directory is unknown relative to a child directory; e.g., when wanting to find a package root from deep within a package directory.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var resolveParentPath = require( '@stdlib/fs/resolve-parent-path' );

var opts = {
    'dir': __dirname
};

/* Sync */

var out = resolveParentPath.sync( 'package.json', opts );
// returns '...'

out = resolveParentPath.sync( 'non_existent_basename' );
// returns null

/* Async */

resolveParentPath( 'package.json', opts, onPath );
resolveParentPath( './../non_existent_path', onPath );

function onPath( error, path ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( path );
}
```
