# resolveParentPathBy

> Resolve a path according to a predicate function by walking parent directories.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var resolveParentPathBy = require( '@stdlib/fs/resolve-parent-path-by' );
```

<a name="resolve-parent-path-by"></a>

#### resolveParentPathBy( path\[, options], predicate, clbk )

Asynchronously resolves a path according to a `predicate` function by walking parent directories.

```javascript
resolveParentPathBy( 'package.json', predicate, onPath );

function predicate( path, next ) {
    var bool = ( /\/test\//.test( path ) === false );
    next( null, bool );
}

function onPath( error, path ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( path );
    // e.g., => '...'
}
```

The function accepts the following `options`:

-   **dir**: base directory from which to begin walking. May be either an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory.

By default, the function begins walking from the current working directory. To specify an alternative directory, set the `dir` option.

```javascript
var opts = {
    'dir': __dirname
};
resolveParentPathBy( 'package.json', opts, predicate, onPath );

function predicate( path, next ) {
    var bool = ( /\/test\//.test( path ) === false );
    next( null, bool );
}

function onPath( error, path ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( path );
    // e.g., => '...'
}
```

When invoked, the `predicate` function is provided two arguments:

-   `path`: a resolved path.
-   `next`: a callback which should be called once the `predicate` function has finished processing a resolved path.

If a `predicate` function calls the `next` callback with a truthy second argument, the function stops processing any additional paths and returns the resolved path as the test result.

If unable to resolve a path, the function returns `null` as the path result.

#### resolveParentPathBy.sync( path\[, options], predicate )

Synchronously resolves a path according to a `predicate` function by walking parent directories.

```javascript
function predicate( path ) {
    return ( /\/test\//.test( path ) === false );
}

var path = resolveParentPathBy.sync( 'package.json', predicate );
// e.g., returns '...'
```

The function accepts the same `options` as [`resolveParentPathBy()`](#resolve-parent-path-by).

When invoked, the `predicate` function is provided one argument:

-   `path`: a resolved path.

The function immediately returns upon encountering a truthy `predicate` function return value.

If unable to resolve a path, the function returns `null` as the path result.

## Notes

-   If a provided `predicate` function calls the `next` callback with a truthy `error` argument, the function suspends execution and immediately calls the `done` callback for subsequent `error` handling.
-   For `resolveParentPathBy`, execution is **not** guaranteed to be asynchronous. To guarantee asynchrony, wrap the `done` callback in a function which either executes at the end of the current stack (e.g., `nextTick`) or during a subsequent turn of the event loop (e.g., `setImmediate`, `setTimeout`).
-   This implementation is **not** similar in functionality to core [`path.resolve`][node-core-path-resolve]. The latter performs string manipulation to generate a full path. This implementation walks parent directories to perform a **search**, thereby touching the file system. Accordingly, this implementation resolves a _real_ absolute file path and is intended for use when a target's location in a parent directory is unknown relative to a child directory; e.g., when wanting to find a package root from deep within a package directory.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/no-dynamic-require -->

```javascript
var resolveParentPathBy = require( '@stdlib/fs/resolve-parent-path-by' );

var opts = {
    'dir': __dirname
};

/* Sync */

function predicateSync( path ) {
    var pkg = require( path );
    if ( pkg.name !== '@stdlib/stdlib' ) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

var out = resolveParentPathBy.sync( 'package.json', opts, predicateSync );
console.log( out );
// e.g., => '...'

out = resolveParentPathBy.sync( 'non_existent_basename/package.json', predicateSync );
console.log( out );
// => null

/* Async */

function predicateAsync( path, next ) {
    setTimeout( onTimeout, 0 );

    function onTimeout() {
        var pkg = require( path );
        if ( pkg.name !== '@stdlib/stdlib' ) {
            return next( null, false );
        }
        next( null, true );
    }
}

function onPath( error, path ) {
    if ( error ) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log( path );
}

resolveParentPathBy( 'package.json', opts, predicateAsync, onPath );
resolveParentPathBy( './../non_existent_path/package.json', predicateAsync, onPath );
```
