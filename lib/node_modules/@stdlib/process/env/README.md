## Notes

-   See [environ(7)][man-environ].
-   Modifications to `ENV` are local to the process in which `ENV` is modified.
-   On Windows systems, environment variables are case insensitive.
-   In browser environments, `ENV` is an **empty** object.
-   Be careful when modifying environment variables as the environment variable object represents shared state. Accordingly, modifications affect all environment variable consumers.
