# ARGV

> Array containing command-line arguments passed when launching the calling process.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var ARGV = require( '@stdlib/process/argv' );
```

#### ARGV

`Array` containing command-line arguments passed when launching the calling process.

```javascript
var execPath = ARGV[ 0 ];
// e.g., returns '/usr/local/bin/node'
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The first element is the absolute pathname of the executable that started the calling process.
-   The second element is the path of the executed file.
-   Any additional elements are additional command-line arguments.
-   In browser environments, `ARGV` is an **empty** array.
-   Modifications to `ARGV` are local to the process in which `ARGV` is modified.
-   Be careful when modifying command-line arguments as the argument array represents shared state. Accordingly, modifications affect all command-line argument consumers.
