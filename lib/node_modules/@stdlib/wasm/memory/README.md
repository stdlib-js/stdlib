## Usage

```javascript
var Memory = require( '@stdlib/wasm/memory' );
```

#### Memory( descriptor )

Returns a new WebAssembly [memory][mdn-webassembly-memory] instance.

```javascript
var mem = new Memory({
    'initial': 0
});
// returns <Memory>
```

The `descriptor` argument is an object which supports the following properties:

-   **initial**: (_required_) initial memory size in units of WebAssembly pages (i.e., 64KiB).
-   **maximum**: maximum memory size in units of WebAssembly pages (i.e., 64KiB).
-   **shared**: boolean indicating whether the memory is shared. Default: `false`.

* * *

<a name="prop-buffer"></a>

#### Memory.prototype.buffer

**Read-only** property which returns the [`ArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/buffer] (or [`SharedArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/shared-buffer]) referenced by memory instance.

```javascript
var mem = new Memory({
    'initial': 0
});

var buf = mem.buffer;
// returns <ArrayBuffer>
```

* * *

### Methods

<a name="method-grow"></a>

#### Memory.prototype.grow( delta )

Increases the size of the memory instance by a specified number of WebAssembly pages (i.e., 64KiB).

```javascript
var mem = new Memory({
    'initial': 0
});

// ...

var prevSize = mem.grow( 1 );
```

The method returns the size of the previous [`ArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/buffer] (or [`SharedArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/shared-buffer]).

## Notes

-   Upon increasing the size, the previous [`ArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/buffer] is detached, thus invalidating any typed arrays which were views over the previous [`ArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/buffer].
-   **Detachment** means that the previous [`ArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/buffer] byte length becomes zero, and it no longer has bytes accessible to JavaScript.
-   When calling `grow`, [`ArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/buffer] detachment applies even when `delta` is zero.
-   Detachment only applies for non-shared memory instances. For a shared memory instance, the initial buffer (which is a [`SharedArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/shared-buffer]) will not become detached and, instead, its length will not be updated.
-   Accesses to the `buffer` property after growing a [`SharedArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/shared-buffer] will yield a larger [`SharedArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/shared-buffer] which may access a larger span of memory than the buffer before growing memory.
-   Every [`SharedArrayBuffer`][@stdlib/array/shared-buffer] accessed via the `buffer` property will always refer to the start of the same memory address range and thus manipulate the same data.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var hasWebAssemblySupport = require( '@stdlib/assert/has-wasm-support' );
var DataView = require( '@stdlib/array/dataview' );
var Memory = require( '@stdlib/wasm/memory' );

function main() {
    var view;
    var mem;
    var v;
    if ( !hasWebAssemblySupport() ) {
        console.error( 'Environment does not support WebAssembly.' );
        return;
    }
    mem = new Memory({
        'initial': 1
    });
    view = new DataView( mem.buffer );

    view.setFloat64( 0, 3.14 );

    // ...

    v = view.getFloat64( 0 );
    console.log( v );
    // => 3.14
}

main();
