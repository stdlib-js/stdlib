## Usage

```javascript
var allocUnsafe = require( '@stdlib/buffer/alloc-unsafe' );
```

#### allocUnsafe( size )

**Unsafely** allocates a [buffer][@stdlib/buffer/ctor] having a specified number of bytes.

```javascript
var buf = allocUnsafe( 10 );
// returns <Buffer>
```

## Notes

-   The underlying memory of returned [`Buffer`][@stdlib/buffer/ctor] instances is **not** initialized. Memory contents are unknown and may contain **sensitive** data.
-   When the `size` is less than half the pool size (specified on the [`Buffer`][@stdlib/buffer/ctor] constructor in modern Node.js environments), memory is allocated from the [`Buffer`][@stdlib/buffer/ctor] pool for faster allocation of new [`Buffer`][@stdlib/buffer/ctor] instances.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var allocUnsafe = require( '@stdlib/buffer/alloc-unsafe' );

var buf;
var i;

// Repeatedly unsafely allocate memory and inspect the buffer contents...
for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    buf = allocUnsafe( 100 );
    console.log( buf.toString() );
}
