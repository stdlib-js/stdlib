> Difference between one and the smallest value greater than one that can be represented as a [double-precision floating-point number][ieee754].

[Epsilon][machine-epsilon] is defined as

## Usage

```javascript
var EPS = require( '@stdlib/constants/float64/eps' );
```

#### EPS

Difference between one and the smallest value greater than one that can be represented as a [double-precision floating-point number][ieee754].

```javascript
var bool = ( EPS === 2.220446049250313e-16 );
// returns true
```

## Examples

```javascript
var abs = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/abs' );
var max = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/max' );
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/base/randu' );
var EPS = require( '@stdlib/constants/float64/eps' );

var bool;
var a;
var b;
var i;

function isApprox( a, b ) {
    var delta;
    var tol;

    delta = abs( a - b );
    tol = EPS * max( abs( a ), abs( b ) );

    return ( delta <= tol );
}

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    a = randu() * 10.0;
    b = a + (randu()*5.0e-15) - 2.5e-15;

    console.log( '%d %s approximately equal to %d. Delta: %d.', a, ( bool ) ? 'is' : 'is not', b, abs( a - b ) );
