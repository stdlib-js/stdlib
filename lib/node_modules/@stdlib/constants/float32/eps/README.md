## Usage

```javascript
var FLOAT32_EPS = require( '@stdlib/constants/float32/eps' );
```

#### FLOAT32_EPS

Difference between one and the smallest value greater than one that can be represented as a [single-precision floating-point number][ieee754].

```javascript
var bool = ( FLOAT32_EPS === 1.1920928955078125e-7 );
// returns true
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var abs = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/abs' );
var max = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/max' );
var float64ToFloat32 = require( '@stdlib/number/float64/base/to-float32' );
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/base/randu' );
var FLOAT32_EPS = require( '@stdlib/constants/float32/eps' );

var bool;
var a;
var b;
var i;

function isApprox( a, b ) {
    var delta;
    var tol;

    delta = float64ToFloat32( abs( a - b ) );
    tol = float64ToFloat32( FLOAT32_EPS * max( abs( a ), abs( b ) ) );

    return ( delta <= tol );
}

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    a = float64ToFloat32( randu()*10.0 );
    b = float64ToFloat32( a + (randu()*2.0e-6) - 1.0e-6 );
    bool = isApprox( a, b );
    console.log( '%d %s approximately equal to %d', a, ( bool ) ? 'is' : 'is not', b );
