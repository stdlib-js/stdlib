# Precision

> Effective number of bits in the [significand][significand] of a [half-precision floating-point number][ieee754].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var FLOAT16_PRECISION = require( '@stdlib/constants/float16/precision' );
```

#### FLOAT16_PRECISION

Effective number of bits in the [significand][significand] of a [half-precision floating-point number][ieee754].

```javascript
var bool = ( FLOAT16_PRECISION === 11 ); // including implicit bit
// returns true
```
