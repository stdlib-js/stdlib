[Epsilon][machine-epsilon] is defined as

where `b` is the radix (base) and `p` is the precision (number of radix bits in the significand). For [half-precision floating-point numbers][half-precision-floating-point-format], `b` is `2` and `p` is `11`.

## Usage

```javascript
var FLOAT16_EPSILON = require( '@stdlib/constants/float16/eps' );
```

#### FLOAT16_EPSILON

Difference between one and the smallest value greater than one that can be represented as a [half-precision floating-point number][half-precision-floating-point-format].

```javascript
var bool = ( FLOAT16_EPSILON === 0.0009765625 );
// returns true
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var abs = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/abs' );
var maxabs = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/maxabs' );
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/base/randu' );
var FLOAT16_EPSILON = require( '@stdlib/constants/float16/eps' );

var bool;
var a;
var b;
var i;

function isApprox( a, b ) {
    var delta;
    var tol;

    delta = abs( a - b );
    tol = FLOAT16_EPSILON * maxabs( a, b );

    return ( delta <= tol );
}

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    a = randu() * 10.0;
    b = a + (randu()*2.0e-3) - 1.0e-3;
    bool = isApprox( a, b );
    console.log( '%d %s approximately equal to %d', a, ( bool ) ? 'is' : 'is not', b );
