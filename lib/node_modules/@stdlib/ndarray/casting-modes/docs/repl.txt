{{alias}}()
    Returns a list of ndarray casting modes.

    The output array contains the following modes:

    - 'none': only allow casting between identical types
    - 'equiv': allow casting between identical and byte swapped types
    - 'safe': only allow "safe" casts
    - 'same-kind': allow "safe" casts and casts within the same kind (e.g.,
    between signed integers or between floats)
    - 'unsafe': allow casting between all types (including between integers and
    floats)

    Returns
