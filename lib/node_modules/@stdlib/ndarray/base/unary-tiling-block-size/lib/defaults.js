// MAIN //

var defaults = {
	// Define a default block size (in bytes):
	'BLOCK_SIZE_IN_BYTES': 64|0, // 64b is a common cache line size. How applicable the common cache line size is here is debatable, given that, depending on the associated stride(s), the innermost loop may not iterate over adjacent elements. The primary goal is to have a block size in which all data within a block can always fit in (L1) cache, regardless of cache size (i.e., cache-oblivious). For reference, a common L1 cache size is 32kB per core. For best performance, block sizes should be tuned based on system hardware; however, such tuning is not readily available to us here. Without obvious better alternatives, 64b has some theoretical (and practical) underpinning, and it should be good enough for most inputs, especially for ndarrays with near contiguity.

	// Define a default block size (in elements):
	'BLOCK_SIZE_IN_ELEMENTS': 8|0 // 64 bytes / 8 bytes per element (i.e., default element size is same as a double)
};
