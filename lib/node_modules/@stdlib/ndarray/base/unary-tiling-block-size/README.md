## Usage

```javascript
var unaryBlockSize = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/unary-tiling-block-size' );
```

#### unaryBlockSize( dtypeX, dtypeY )

Resolves a loop block size according to provided ndarray [dtypes][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] for multi-dimensional array tiled loops applying a unary function.

```javascript
var bsize = unaryBlockSize( 'float64', 'float64' );
// returns <number>
```

## Notes

-   The returned loop tiling block size is in units of elements.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes' );
var cartesianSquare = require( '@stdlib/array/base/cartesian-square' );
var unaryBlockSize = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/unary-tiling-block-size' );

// Generate a list of ndarray dtype pairs:
var dt = cartesianSquare( dtypes() );

// Resolve the block size for each dtype pair...
var b;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    b = unaryBlockSize.apply( null, dt[ i ] );
    console.log( '%d, %s, %s', b, dt[i][0], dt[i][1] );
}
