{{alias}}( value, dtype, shape, order )
    Broadcasts a scalar value to an ndarray having a specified shape.

    If `value` is a number and `dtype` is a complex number data type, the
    function returns an ndarray containing a complex number whose real component
    equals the provided scalar value and whose imaginary component is zero.

    The returned array is a view on an ndarray data buffer. The view is *not*
    contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view may refer to the
    same memory location, writing to the view may affect multiple elements. If
    you need to write to the returned array, copy the array before performing
    operations which may mutate elements.

    The returned array is a "base" ndarray, and, thus, the returned array does
    not perform bounds checking or afford any of the guarantees of the non-base
    ndarray constructor. The primary intent of this function is to broadcast a
    scalar value as an ndarray within internal implementations and to do so with
    minimal overhead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value: any
        Scalar value.

    dtype: string
        Data type.

    shape: ArrayLike<number>
        Array shape.

    order: string
        Memory layout (either 'row-major' or 'column-major').

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias}}( 1.0, 'float64', [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' )
    <ndarray>
    > var sh = x.shape
    [ 2, 2 ]
    > var dt = x.dtype
    'float64'
    > var v = x.get( 0, 1 )
    1.0
