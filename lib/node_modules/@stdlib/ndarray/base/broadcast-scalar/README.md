## Usage

```javascript
var broadcastScalar = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-scalar' );
```

#### broadcastScalar( value, dtype, shape, order )

Broadcast a scalar value to an [`ndarray`][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] having a specified shape and [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes].

```javascript
var x = broadcastScalar( 1.0, 'float64', [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' );
// returns <ndarray>

var sh = x.shape;
// returns [ 2, 2 ]

var dt = x.dtype;
// returns 'float64'

var v = x.get( 0, 0 );
// returns 1.0
```

## Notes

-   If `value` is a number and [`dtype`][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] is a complex [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes], the function returns an [`ndarray`][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] containing a complex number whose real component equals the provided scalar `value` and whose imaginary component is zero.
-   The returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is a view on an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] data buffer containing a single element. The view is **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view may refer to the same memory location, writing to the view may affect multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], copy the [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] **before** performing operations which may mutate elements.
-   The returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is a "base" [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], and, thus, the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] does not perform bounds checking or afford any of the guarantees of the non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] constructor. The primary intent of this function is to broadcast a scalar value as an [`ndarray`][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] within internal implementations and to do so with minimal overhead.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes' );
var broadcastScalar = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-scalar' );

// Get a list of data types:
var dt = dtypes();

// Generate two-dimensional arrays...
var x;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    x = broadcastScalar( i, dt[ i ], [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' );
    console.log( x.get( 0, 1 ) );
}
