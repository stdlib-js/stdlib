## Usage

```javascript
var maybeBroadcastArrays = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/maybe-broadcast-arrays' );
```

#### maybeBroadcastArrays( arrays )

Broadcasts [ndarrays][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] to a common shape.

```javascript
var array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/array' );
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/zeros' );

// Create a 2x2 ndarray:
var x = array( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] );
// returns <ndarray>

// Create a 2x2x2 ndarray:
var y = zeros( [ 2, 2, 2 ] );
// returns <ndarray>

// Broadcast to a common shape:
var out = maybeBroadcastArrays( [ x, y ] );
// returns [ <ndarray>, <ndarray> ]
```

## Notes

-   The function throws an error if a provided [broadcast-incompatible][@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-shapes] ndarrays.
-   If a provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] has a shape matching the common shape, the function returns the provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor].
-   If a provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] has a different (broadcast compatible) shape than the common shape, the function returns a new (base) [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] view of the provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor]'s data. The view is typically **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view may refer to the same memory location, writing to a view may affect multiple elements. If you need to write to a returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], copy the [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] **before** performing operations which may mutate elements.
-   A returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is a "base" [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], and, thus, a returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] view does not perform bounds checking or afford any of the guarantees of the non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] constructor. The primary intent of this function is to broadcast ndarray-like objects within internal implementations and to do so with minimal overhead.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/array' );
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/zeros' );
var numel = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/numel' );
var ind2sub = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/ind2sub' );
var maybeBroadcastArrays = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/maybe-broadcast-arrays' );

// Create a 2x2 array:
var x = array( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] );
// returns <ndarray>

// Create a 3x2x2 array:
var y = zeros( [ 3, 2, 2 ] );
// returns <ndarray>

// Broadcast arrays to a common shape:
var out = maybeBroadcastArrays( [ x, y ] );
// returns <ndarray>

// Retrieve the common shape:
var sh = out[ 0 ].shape;
// returns [ 3, 2, 2 ]

// Retrieve the number of elements:
var N = numel( sh );

// Loop through the array elements...
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < N; i++ ) {
    console.log( 'X[%s] = %d', ind2sub( sh, i ).join( ', ' ), out[ 0 ].iget( i ) );
}
```
