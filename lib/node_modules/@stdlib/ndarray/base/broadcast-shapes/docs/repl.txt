{{alias}}( shapes )
    Broadcasts array shapes to a single shape.

    Two respective dimensions in two shape arrays are compatible if

    1. the dimensions are equal.
    2. one dimension is `1`.

    The function returns `null` if provided incompatible shapes (i.e., shapes
    which cannot be broadcast with one another).

    Parameters
    ----------
    shapes: Array
        Array of shape arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array|null
        Broadcast shape.

    Examples
    --------
    // Compatible shapes:
    > var sh1 = [ 8, 1, 6, 1 ];
    > var sh2 = [ 7, 1, 5 ];
    > var sh = {{alias}}( [ sh1, sh2 ] )
    [ 8, 7, 6, 5 ]

    // Incompatible shapes:
    > sh1 = [ 3, 2 ];
    > sh1 = [ 2, 3 ];
    > sh = {{alias}}( [ sh1, sh2 ] )
    null
