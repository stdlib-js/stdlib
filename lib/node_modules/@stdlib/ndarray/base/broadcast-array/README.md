## Usage

```javascript
var broadcastArray = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-array' );
```

#### broadcastArray( arr, shape )

Broadcasts an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] to a specified `shape`.

```javascript
var array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/array' );

// Create a 2x2 ndarray:
var x = array( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] );
// returns <ndarray>

// Broadcast to a 2x2x2 ndarray:
var y = broadcastArray( x, [ 2, 2, 2 ] );
// returns <ndarray>
```

## Notes

-   The function throws an error if a provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is [incompatible][@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-shapes] with a provided shape.
-   The returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is a view on the input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] data buffer. The view is typically **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view may refer to the same memory location, writing to the view may affect multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], copy the [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] **before** performing operations which may mutate elements.
-   The returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is a "base" [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], and, thus, the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] does not perform bounds checking or afford any of the guarantees of the non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] constructor. The primary intent of this function is to broadcast an ndarray-like object within internal implementations and to do so with minimal overhead.
-   The function always returns a new [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] instance even if the input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] shape and the desired shape are the same.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/array' );
var numel = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/numel' );
var ind2sub = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/ind2sub' );
var broadcastArray = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-array' );

// Create a 2x2 array:
var x = array( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] );
// returns <ndarray>

// Broadcast the array to 3x2x2:
var y = broadcastArray( x, [ 3, 2, 2 ] );
// returns <ndarray>

// Retrieve the shape:
var sh = y.shape;
// returns [ 3, 2, 2 ]

// Retrieve the number of elements:
var N = numel( sh );

// Loop through the array elements...
var sub;
var v;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < N; i++ ) {
    v = y.iget( i );
    sub = ind2sub( sh, i );
    console.log( 'Y[%s] = %d', sub.join( ', ' ), v );
}
```
