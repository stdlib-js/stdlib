{{alias}}( arr, shape )
    Broadcasts an ndarray to a specified shape.

    The returned array is a view on the input array data buffer. The view is
    typically **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view
    may refer to the same memory location, writing to the view may affect
    multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned array, copy the
    array before performing operations which may mutate elements.

    The returned array is a "base" ndarray, and, thus, the returned array does
    not perform bounds checking or afford any of the guarantees of the non-base
    ndarray constructor. The primary intent of this function is to broadcast an
    ndarray-like object within internal implementations and to do so with
    minimal overhead.

    The function throws an error if a provided ndarray is incompatible with a
    provided shape.

    The function always returns a new ndarray instance even if the input ndarray
    shape and the desired shape are the same.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ndarray
        Input array.

    shape: ArrayLikeObject
        Desired shape.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        Broadcasted array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/array}}( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] )
    <ndarray>
    > var sh = x.shape
    [ 2, 2 ]
    > var y = {{alias}}( x, [ 3, 2, 2 ] )
    <ndarray>
    > sh = y.shape
    [ 3, 2, 2 ]
    > var v = y.get( 0, 0, 0 )
    1
    > v = y.get( 0, 0, 1 )
    2
    > v = y.get( 0, 1, 0 )
    3
    > v = y.get( 0, 1, 1 )
    4
    > v = y.get( 1, 0, 0 )
    1
    > v = y.get( 1, 1, 0 )
    3
    > v = y.get( 2, 0, 0 )
    1
    > v = y.get( 2, 1, 1 )
    4
