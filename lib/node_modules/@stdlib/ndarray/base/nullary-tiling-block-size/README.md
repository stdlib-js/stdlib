## Usage

```javascript
var nullaryBlockSize = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/nullary-tiling-block-size' );
```

#### nullaryBlockSize( dtypeX )

Resolves a loop block size according to provided ndarray [dtypes][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] for multi-dimensional array tiled loops applying a nullary function.

```javascript
var bsize = nullaryBlockSize( 'float64' );
// returns <number>
```

## Examples

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes' );
var nullaryBlockSize = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/nullary-tiling-block-size' );

// Get the list of ndarray dtypes:
var dt = dtypes();

// Resolve the block size for each dtype...
var b;
var i;
console.log( 'block_size, xdtype' );
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    b = nullaryBlockSize( dt[ i ] );
    console.log( '%d, %s', b, dt[ i ] );
}
