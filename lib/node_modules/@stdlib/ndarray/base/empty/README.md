## Usage

```javascript
var empty = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/empty' );
```

#### empty( dtype, shape, order )

Creates an uninitialized [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] having a specified shape and [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes].

```javascript
var arr = empty( 'float64', [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' );
// returns <ndarray>

var sh = arr.shape;
// returns [ 2, 2 ]

var dt = arr.dtype;
// returns 'float64'
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **dtype**: underlying [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes].
-   **shape**: array shape.
-   **order**: specifies whether an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is `'row-major'` (C-style) or `'column-major'` (Fortran-style).

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If `dtype` is `'generic'`, the function always returns a zero-filled array.
-   For returned [ndarrays][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] whose underlying memory is **not** initialized, memory contents are unknown and may contain **sensitive** data.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes' );
var empty = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/empty' );

// Get a list of data types:
var dt = dtypes();

// Generate uninitialized arrays...
var arr;
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    arr = empty( dt[ i ], [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' );
    console.log( arr.data );
}
