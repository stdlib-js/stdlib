## Usage

```javascript
var buffer = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/buffer' );
```

#### buffer( dtype, size )

Returns a zero-filled contiguous linear ndarray data buffer.

```javascript
var buf = buffer( 'float64', 3 );
// returns <Float64Array>[ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]
```

The function supports the following data types:

-   `binary`: binary.
-   `complex64`: single-precision complex floating-point numbers.
-   `complex128`: double-precision complex floating-point numbers.
-   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers.
-   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers.
-   `generic`: values of any type.
-   `int16`: signed 16-bit integers.
-   `int32`: signed 32-bit integers.
-   `int8`: signed 8-bit integers.
-   `uint16`: unsigned 16-bit integers.
-   `uint32`: unsigned 32-bit integers.
-   `uint8`: unsigned 8-bit integers.
-   `uint8c`: unsigned clamped 8-bit integers.

If provided an unknown or unsupported data type, the function returns `null`.

```javascript
var buf = buffer( 'float', 3 );
// returns null
```
