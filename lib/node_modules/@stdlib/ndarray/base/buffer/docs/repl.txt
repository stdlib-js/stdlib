    - binary: binary.
    - complex64: single-precision complex floating-point numbers.
    - complex128: double-precision complex floating-point numbers.
    - float32: single-precision floating-point numbers.
    - float64: double-precision floating-point numbers.
    - generic: values of any type.
    - int16: signed 16-bit integers.
    - int32: signed 32-bit integers.
    - int8: signed 8-bit integers.
    - uint16: unsigned 16-bit integers.
    - uint32: unsigned 32-bit integers.
    - uint8: unsigned 8-bit integers.
    - uint8c: unsigned clamped 8-bit integers.
