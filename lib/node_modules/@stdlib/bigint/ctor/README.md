## Notes

-   Unlike conventional constructors, the function does **not** support the `new` keyword.
-   The function is only supported in environments which support [`BigInt`][mdn-bigint]. In non-supporting environments, the value is `undefined`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var hasBigIntSupport = require( '@stdlib/assert/has-bigint-support' );
var BigInt = require( '@stdlib/bigint/ctor' );

var v;

if ( hasBigIntSupport() ) {
    v = BigInt( '1' );

    // Print the value type:
    console.log( typeof v );
    // => 'bigint'

    // Serialize the BigInt as a string:
    console.log( v.toString() );
    // => '1'
} else {
    console.log( 'Environment does not support BigInts.' );
}
