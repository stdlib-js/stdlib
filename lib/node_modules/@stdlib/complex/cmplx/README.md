## Usage

```javascript
var complex = require( '@stdlib/complex/cmplx' );
```

#### complex( real, imag\[, dtype] )

Creates a complex number, where `real` and `imag` are the **real** and **imaginary** components, respectively.

```javascript
var z = complex( 5.0, 3.0 );
// returns <Complex128>
```

By default, the function returns a [128-bit complex number][@stdlib/complex/float64]. To specify an alternative underlying data type, set the `dtype` parameter to one of the following:

-   [`'float64'`][@stdlib/complex/float64]: store **real** and **imaginary** components as double-precision floating-point numbers.
-   [`'float32'`][@stdlib/complex/float32]: store **real** and **imaginary** components as single-precision floating-point numbers.

```javascript
var z = complex( 5.0, 3.0, 'float32' );
// returns <Complex64>
```

```javascript
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/base/randu' );
var round = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/round' );
var complex = require( '@stdlib/complex/cmplx' );

var re;
var im;
var z;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    re = round( (randu()*100.0) - 50.0 );
    im = round( (randu()*100.0) - 50.0 );
    z = complex( re, im, 'float64' );
    console.log( z.toString() );
}
