# Promotion Rules

> Return the complex number [data type][@stdlib/complex/dtypes] with the smallest size and closest "kind" to which data types can be **safely** cast.

## Usage

```javascript
var promotionRules = require( '@stdlib/complex/promotion-rules' );
```

#### promotionRules( \[dtype1, dtype2] )

If provided data types, returns the complex number [data type][@stdlib/complex/dtypes] with the smallest size and closest "kind" to which data types can be **safely** cast.

```javascript
var out = promotionRules( 'complex128', 'complex64' );
// returns 'complex128'
```

If not provided data types, the function returns a promotion table.

```javascript
var out = promotionRules();
// returns {...}

var c128 = out[ 'complex128' ];
// returns {...}

var rule = c128[ 'uint32' ];
// returns 'complex128'
```

If provided an unrecognized or unsupported `dtype`, the function returns `null`.

```javascript
var out = promotionRules( 'foo', 'complex128' );
// returns null
```

## Notes

-   If a [data type][@stdlib/complex/dtypes] to which data types can be safely cast does **not** exist (or is not supported), the function returns `-1`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/complex/dtypes' );
var promotionRules = require( '@stdlib/complex/promotion-rules' );

var DTYPES;
var dt1;
var dt2;
var dt;
var i;
var j;

// Get the list of supported data types:
DTYPES = dtypes();

// Print the promotion rule for each pair of data types...
for ( i = 0; i < DTYPES.length; i++ ) {
    dt1 = DTYPES[ i ];
    for ( j = 0; j < DTYPES.length; j++ ) {
        dt2 = DTYPES[ j ];
        dt = promotionRules( dt1, dt2 );
        console.log( '(%s, %s) => %s', dt1, dt2, dt );
    }
}
