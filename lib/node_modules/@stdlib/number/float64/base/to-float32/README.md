# toFloat32

> Convert a [double-precision floating-point number][ieee754] to the nearest [single-precision floating-point number][ieee754].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var float64ToFloat32 = require( '@stdlib/number/float64/base/to-float32' );
```

#### float64ToFloat32( x )

Converts a [double-precision floating-point number][ieee754] to the nearest [single-precision floating-point number][ieee754].

```javascript
var y = float64ToFloat32( 1.337 );
// returns 1.3370000123977661
```
