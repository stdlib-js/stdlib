    gen( x, name )

Generate fixture data and write to file.

# Arguments

* `x`: domain
* `name::AbstractString`: output filename

# Examples

``` julia
julia> x = range( 0, stop = 4294967295, length = 1000 );
julia> gen( x, \"data.json\" );
```

	data = Dict([
		("x", y),
		("expected", z)

	# Based on the script directory, create an output filepath:
	filepath = joinpath( dir, name );

	# Write the data to the output filepath as JSON:
	outfile = open( filepath, "w" );
	write( outfile, JSON.json(data) );
	write( outfile, "\n" );
	close( outfile );

# Get the filename:

# Extract the directory in which this file resides:
dir = dirname( file );

# Test values:
x = range( 0, stop = 4294967295, length = 1000 );
