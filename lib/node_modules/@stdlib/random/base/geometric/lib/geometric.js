/**
* Returns a pseudorandom number drawn from a geometric distribution.
*
* ## Proof
*
* Consider
*
* ```tex
* N = \left \lfloor \ln (U) / \ln (1-p) \right \rfloor
* ```
*
* where \\( U \\) is uniform on the interval \\((0,1)\\). Accordingly, \\(N\\) must be a nonnegative integer, and, for every \\( n \geq 0\\), the event \\(A_n = \left \{ N = n \right \}\\) is
*
* ```tex
* A_n = \left \{(n+1) \ln (1-p) < \ln (U) \leq n \ln (1-p) \right \}
* ```
*
* where \\(\ln (1-p) < 0\\). Thus,
*
* ```tex
* A_n = \left \{(1-p)^{n+1} < U \leq (1-p)^n \right \}
* ```
*
* For every \\(u < v\\) on the interval \\((0,1)\\),
*
* ```tex
* P\left \[u < U \leq v\right \] = v - u
* ```
*
* Hence,
*
* ```tex
* P\left \[N = n \right \] = P\left \[A_n\right \] = (1-p)^n - (1-p)^{n+1} = (1-p)^n(1-(1-p)) = p(1-p)^n
* ```
*
* which proves that \\(N\\) is a geometric random variable.
*
* @private
* @param {PRNG} rand - PRNG for uniformly distributed numbers
* @param {Probability} p - success probability
* @returns {NonNegativeInteger} pseudorandom number
