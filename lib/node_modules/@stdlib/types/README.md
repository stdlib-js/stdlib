## Usage

```typescript
/// <reference types="@stdlib/types"/>

import { ArrayLike } from '@stdlib/types/array';

function sum( x: ArrayLike<number> ): number {
    let s = 0.0;
    for ( let i = 0; i < x.length; i++ ) {
        s += x[ i ];
    }
    return s;
}
```

Type declarations are organized as modules. For example, to use iterator type declarations,

```typescript
/// <reference types="@stdlib/types"/>

import { Iterator } from '@stdlib/types/iter';

function sum( iter: Iterator ): number {
    let s = 0.0;
    while ( true ) {
        let v = iter.next();
        if ( v.done ) {
            break;
        }
        s += v.value;
    }
    return s;
}
```

For the complete list of declared modules, see the `index.d.ts` type declaration file.

## Notes

-   In order to use included TypeScript declarations, configure your `tsconfig.json` file accordingly. For example,

    ```text
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        ...
        "typeRoots": [ "./path/to/@stdlib/types" ],
        ...
      },
      ...
    }
    ```
