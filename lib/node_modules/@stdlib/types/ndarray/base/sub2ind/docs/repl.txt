{{alias}}( shape, strides, offset, ...subscript, mode )
    Converts subscripts to a linear index.

    When provided a stride array containing negative strides, if an `offset` is
    greater than `0`, the function treats subscripts as mapping to a linear
    index in an underlying data buffer for the array, thus returning a linear
    index from the perspective of that buffer. If an `offset` is equal to `0`,
    the function treats subscripts as mapping to a linear index in an array
    view, thus returning a linear index from the perspective of that view. In
    short, from the perspective of a view, view data is always ordered.

    When provided fewer modes than dimensions, the function recycles modes using
    modulo arithmetic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape: ArrayLike
        Array shape.

    strides: ArrayLike
        Stride array.

    offset: integer
        Location of the first indexed value based on the stride array.

    subscript: ...integer
        Subscripts.

    mode: Array<string>
        Specifies how to handle subscripts which exceed array dimensions for
        each dimension. If the mode for a dimension is equal to 'throw', the
        function throws an error when a subscript exceeds array dimensions. If
        equal to 'wrap', the function wraps around subscripts exceeding array
        dimensions using modulo arithmetic. If equal to 'clamp', the function
        sets subscripts exceeding array dimensions to either `0` (minimum index)
        or the maximum index along a particular dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    idx: integer
        Linear index.

    Examples
    --------
    > var d = [ 3, 3, 3 ];
    > var s = [ 9, 3, 1 ];
    > var o = 0;
    > var idx = {{alias}}( d, s, o, 1, 2, 2, [ 'throw' ] )
