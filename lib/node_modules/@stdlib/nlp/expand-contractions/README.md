## Notes

* This expansion is done via a simple table look-up. Hence, it will not correctly replace contractions for which there are multiple possible expansions such as `"She'd"`, which can be expanded to both `"She would"` or `"She had"`. In such cases, the package expands to a chosen default, in the given example `"She would"`. Should you desire higher accuracy, consider using a fully-fledged NLP disambiguation algorithm for English contractions.
