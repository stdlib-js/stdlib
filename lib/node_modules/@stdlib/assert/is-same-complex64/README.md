# isSameComplex64

> Test if two arguments are both [single-precision complex floating-point numbers][@stdlib/complex/float32] and have the [same value][@stdlib/assert/is-same-value].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var isSameComplex64 = require( '@stdlib/assert/is-same-complex64' );
```

#### isSameComplex64( v1, v2 )

Tests if two arguments are both [single-precision complex floating-point numbers][@stdlib/complex/float32] and have the [same value][@stdlib/assert/is-same-value].

```javascript
var Complex64 = require( '@stdlib/complex/float32' );

var x = new Complex64( 1.0, 2.0 );
var y = new Complex64( 1.0, 2.0 );
var bool = isSameComplex64( x, y );
// returns true
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   In contrast to the strict equality operator `===`, the function distinguishes between `+0` and `-0` and treats `NaNs` as the [same value][@stdlib/assert/is-same-value].

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var Complex64 = require( '@stdlib/complex/float32' );
var isSameComplex64 = require( '@stdlib/assert/is-same-complex64' );

var x = new Complex64( 1.0, 2.0 );
var y = new Complex64( 1.0, 2.0 );
var out = isSameComplex64( x, y );
// returns true

x = new Complex64( 0.0, -0.0 );
y = new Complex64( -0.0, 0.0 );
out = isSameComplex64( x, y );
// returns false

x = new Complex64( NaN, NaN );
y = new Complex64( NaN, NaN );
out = isSameComplex64( x, y );
// returns true
```
