/**
* Tests if a value is a `TypeError` object.
*
* ## Notes
*
* - This function should **not** be considered robust. While the function should always return `true` if provided a TypeError (or a descendant) object, false positives may occur due to the fact that the TypeError constructor inherits from Error and has no internal class of its own. Hence, TypeError impersonation is possible.
*
* @param value - value to test
* @returns boolean indicating whether a value is a `TypeError` object
*
* @example
* var bool = isTypeError( new TypeError( 'beep' ) );
* // returns true
*
* @example
* var bool = isTypeError( {} );
* // returns false
*/
