{{alias}}( value )
    Tests if a value is a duration string.

    The function validates that a value is a string. For all other types, the
    function returns `false`.

    A duration string is a string containing a sequence of time units. A time
    unit is a non-negative integer followed by a unit identifier. The following
    unit identifiers are supported:

    - d: days.
    - h: hours.
    - m: minutes.
    - s: seconds.
    - ms: milliseconds.

    For example, the string `1m3s10ms` is a duration string containing three
    time units: `1m` (1 minute), `3s` (3 seconds), and `10ms` (10 milliseconds).
    The string `60m` is a duration string containing a single time unit: `60m`
    (60 minutes). Time units must be supplied in descending order of magnitude
    (i.e., days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds).

    Duration strings are case insensitive. For example, the string `1M3S10MS` is
    equivalent to `1m3s10ms`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value: any
        Value to test.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: boolean
        Boolean indicating whether value is a duration string.

    --------
    > var bool = {{alias}}( '1d' )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( '1h' )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( 'beep' )
