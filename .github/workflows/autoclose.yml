            Thank you for working on this pull request. However, we cannot accept your contribution as this pull request does not follow our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

            Per the guidelines outlined in our [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/development.md), you should download and setup [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to ensure that files are automatically configured to use expected indentation and line endings.

            If you would prefer to avoid manual setup, you could also consider using a pre-configured [development container](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for use locally or in GitHub Codespaces.

            Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contriubtions.

            Per the guidelines outlined in our [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/development.md), you should have setup your local development environment such that automated development processes for linting, license verification, and unit testing can run prior to authoring commits and pushing changes. We encourage you to refer to that guide **before** continuing to work on this pull request.

            Thank you for working on this pull request. However, we cannot accept your contribution as this pull request does not follow project conventions.

            We place a high value on consistency throughout the stdlib codebase, and this pull request was found to significantly deviate from stdlib conventions. We encourage you to closely examine other packages in stdlib and attempt to emulate the practices and conventions found therein.

            -   If you are attempting to contribute a new package, sometimes the best approach is to simply copy the contents of an existing package and then modify the minimum amount necessary to implement the feature (e.g., changing descriptions, parameter names, and implementation).
            -   If you are contributing tests, find a package implementing a similar feature and emulate the tests of that package.
            -   If you are updating documentation, examine several similar packages and emulate the content, style, and prose of those packages.

            In short, the more effort you put in to ensure that your contribution looks and feels like stdlib—including variables names, bracket spacing, line breaks, etc—the more likely that your contribution will be reviewed and ultimately accepted. We encourage you to closely study the codebase **before** continuing to work on this pull request.

            Thank you again for your interest in stdlib, and we look forward to reviewing your future contriubtions.
