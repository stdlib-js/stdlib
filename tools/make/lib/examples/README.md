```

### Commands

#### examples

Runs examples.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make examples
```

The command supports the following environment variables:

-   **EXAMPLES_FILTER**: file path pattern; e.g., `.*/blas/base/dasum/.*`.

This command is an **alias** for `examples-javascript`, which is documented below.

#### examples-lang

Runs cross-language examples.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make examples-lang
```

The command supports the environment variables supported by each language-specific (`examples-<lang>`) command documented below.

This command is useful when wanting to glob for examples files, irrespective of language, for a particular package in order to compare cross-language behavior.

### C

> **Note**: C examples commands delegate to local Makefiles which are responsible for actually compiling and running the respective examples.

#### examples-c

Runs C examples.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make examples-c
```

The command supports the following environment variables:

-   **EXAMPLES_FILTER**: file path pattern; e.g., `.*/math/base/special/abs/.*`.
-   **BLAS**: BLAS library name; e.g., `openblas`.
-   **BLAS_DIR**: BLAS directory.
-   **C_COMPILER**: C compiler; e.g., `gcc`.

This command is useful when wanting to glob for C examples files (e.g., run all C examples for a particular package).

#### examples-c-files

Runs a specified list of C examples files.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make examples-c-files FILES='/foo/example.c /bar/example.c'
```

The command supports the following environment variables:

-   **FILES**: list of C examples files.
-   **BLAS**: BLAS library name; e.g., `openblas`.
-   **BLAS_DIR**: BLAS directory.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make examples-cpp-files FILES='/foo/example.cpp /bar/example.cpp'
```

The command supports the following environment variables:

-   **FILES**: list of C++ examples files.
-   **CXX_COMPILER**: C++ compiler; e.g., `g++`.

```bash
$ make examples-javascript-files FILES='/foo/example.js /bar/example.js'
```

The command supports the following environment variables:

-   **FILES**: list of JavaScript examples files.

This command is useful when wanting to run a list of JavaScript examples files generated by some other command (e.g., a filtered list of changed JavaScript examples files obtained via `git diff`).
