## Usage

```text
Usage: make <command> [<ENV_VAR>=<value> <ENV_VAR>=<value> ...]
```

### Commands

#### commit

Provides an interactive prompt for creating a Git commit message in accordance with the project's [Git style guide][stdlib-style-guides-git].

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make commit
```

#### retry-commit

Retries a previous commit created using `make commit`.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make retry-commit
```

This is particularly useful a commit failed due to lint errors. An example workflow might proceed as follows:

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
# Stage changed files and attempt to commit the changes:
$ git add . && make commit

# Suppose `make commit` fails due to lint errors, so we resolve the lint errors.

# Stage the changes and re-attempt the commit, without having to re-enter commit info:
$ git add . && make retry-commit
```
