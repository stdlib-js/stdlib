## Usage

```text
Usage: make <command> [<ENV_VAR>=<value> <ENV_VAR>=<value> ...]
```

### Commands

#### scaffold

Scaffold required files for a new or existing package. The command will create highly customized files when the package directory already contains at least the `README.md` file; otherwise, the command will create a default `README.md` and scaffold the remaining files using placeholder values.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make scaffold SCAFFOLD_PKG=<pkg>
```

The command expects the following environment variables to be set:

-   **SCAFFOLD_PKG**: package to scaffold, e.g., `math/base/special/sin`.
-   **SCAFFOLD_API_KEY**: API key for accessing the stdlib scaffolding service.
