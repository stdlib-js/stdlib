# Makefile

> Development utility.

This project uses [`make`][make] as its development utility. For an overview of `make`, see the `make` [manual][make]. 

## Usage

#### Help

To view a list of available `Makefile` targets,

```bash
$ make help
```

* * *

#### REPL

To launch a REPL,

```bash
$ make repl
```

* * *

#### Notes

Annotating source code is a useful means for inlining action items and notes. For example,

<!-- eslint-disable no-warning-comments -->

```javascript
// FIXME: don't release the zalgo!
function foo( cb ) {
    if ( bar ) {
        return asyncFcn( cb );
    }
    cb();
}
```

To retrieve source code annotations,

```bash
$ make notes
```

The following annotations are recognized:

-   **TODO**: annotates a future task.
-   **FIXME**: annotates a problem.
-   **HACK**: annotates fragile/non-general solutions.
-   **WARNING**: annotates possible pitfalls or gotchas.
-   **OPTIMIZE**: annotates code which needs optimizing.
-   **NOTE**: annotates questions, comments, or anything which does not fit under `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`/`WARNING`/`OPTIMIZE` and should be brought to a reader's attention.

* * *

#### Files

The `Makefile` exposes several targets (also used internally) for finding project files. For example, to list all project files, excluding `node_modules`, `build`, `reports`, and hidden directories,

```bash
$ make list-files
```

To filter based on a file name or pattern,

```bash
# List only README.md files...
$ make FILES_PATTERN=README.md list-files
```

To filter based on a file path,

```bash
# List all files in the is-nan utils directory...
$ make FILES_FILTER=".*/assert/is-nan/.*" list-files
```

**Notes**:

-   Most filters should begin with `.*/` and end with `/.*`, as a filter is used as a regular expression to test a file path.

-   The `*_PATTERN` and `*_FILTER` environment variables map to `-name` and `-regex` options, respectively, for the `find` command. For certain types of operations, like regular expressions using `|` for alternative matches, you may need to use `*_FILTER` over `*_PATTERN`. For instance,

    ```bash
    # List all `R` test fixtures...
    $ make TESTS_FIXTURES_PATTERN=*.R

    # List all `R` and `Julia` test fixtures...
    $ make TESTS_FIXTURES_FILTER='.*/*\.(jl|R)' list-test-fixtures
    ```

The `Makefile` includes the following common recipes for listing different file types...

##### Sources

To list all source files, excluding examples, benchmarks, and tests,

```bash
$ make list-sources
```

To filter based on a file name or pattern,

```bash
# List only source files having the filename `index.js`...
$ make SOURCES_PATTERN=index.js list-sources
```

To filter based on a file path,

```bash
# List only source files found in a math directory...
$ make SOURCES_FILTER=".*/math/.*" list-sources
```

##### Tests

To list all test files,

```bash
$ make list-tests
```

To filter based on a file name or pattern,

```bash
# List only the main test files...
$ make TESTS_PATTERN=test.js list-tests
```

To filter based on a file path,

```bash
# List only test files in the fs directory...
$ make TESTS_FILTER=".*/fs/.*" list-tests
```

##### Test Fixtures

To list all test fixture files,

```bash
$ make list-tests-fixtures
```

To filter based on a file name or pattern,

```bash
# List only the Julia test fixtures...
$ make TESTS_FIXTURES_PATTERN=*.jl list-tests-fixtures
```

To filter based on a file path,

```bash
# List only test fixture files in the base math directory for special functions...
$ make TESTS_FIXTURES_FILTER=".*/math/special/.*" list-tests-fixtures
```

##### Benchmarks

To list all benchmark files,

```bash
$ make list-benchmarks
```

To filter based on a file name or pattern,

```bash
# List only the main benchmark files...
$ make BENCHMARKS_PATTERN=benchmark.js list-benchmarks
```

To filter based on a file path,

```bash
# List only benchmark files for base special math functions...
$ make BENCHMARKS_FILTER=".*/math/base/special/.*" list-benchmarks
```

##### Examples

```bash
# List only the example files for special functions in the base math directory...
$ make EXAMPLES_FILTER=".*/math/base/special/.*" list-examples
```

##### Packages

To list all packages (as absolute paths),

```bash
$ make list-pkgs
```

To filter based on a file path,

```bash
# List only the special function packages in the base math directory...
$ make PACKAGES_FILTER=".*/math/base/special/.*" list-pkgs
```

To list all package names under the `@stdlib` scope,

```bash
$ make list-pkgs-names
```

To list all package names under a `@stdlib` descendant directory,

```bash
$ make SRC_DIR=./@stdlib/math/base list-pkgs-names
```

* * *

#### Package Examples

To run package examples,

```bash
$ make examples
```

To limit which examples are run, use the same environment variables recognized by `list-examples`.

```bash
# Only run the examples for special functions in the base math directory...
$ make EXAMPLES_FILTER=".*/math/base/special/.*" EXAMPLES_PATTERN=index.js examples
```

* * *

#### Unit Tests

To run unit tests,

```bash
$ make test
```

To generate a test summary,

```bash
$ make test-summary
```

```bash
# Run only the main test file for base math utils...
$ make TESTS_FILTER=".*/math/base/utils/.*" TESTS_PATTERN=test.js test

# Run all blas tests...
$ make TESTS_FILTER=".*/math/base/blas/.*"  test-summary
```

To run unit tests against specific Node.js versions (assuming [`nvm`][nvm] is installed),

```bash
$ make test-node-versions
```

By default, tests are run against supported Node.js versions. To run against alternative versions, set the `NODE_VERSIONS` environment variable.

```bash
$ make NODE_VERSIONS='0.10 4 6' TESTS_FILTER=".*/fs/exists/.*" test-node-versions
```

To run units tests for project tools,

$ make TESTS_FILTER=".*/math/base/utils/.*" test-cov
```

To generate a coverage report for project tools,

```bash
$ make tools-test-cov
```

To limit which tests are run, use the same environment variables recognized by `list-tests`.

```bash
$ make tools-test-cov TESTS_FILTER=".*/search/.*" TESTS_PATTERN=test.js
```

```bash
$ make test-browsers
```

To run and view the tests in a local web browser,

```bash

#### Dependencies

To check whether dependencies are up-to-date,

#### Bash Completion

To enable [bash completion][bash-completion] of Makefile targets, add

```text
complete -W "\`find . ! \( -path \"*/node_modules/*\" -prune \) -and \( -name 'Makefile' -o -name '*.mk' \) | xargs grep '^.PHONY: ' | awk '{print $2}'\`" make
```

to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`. Note that completion is **not** exhaustive, as the above only includes targets which have been **explicitly** declared phony targets

```text
.PHONY: beep-boop
```

and does not include targets declared via variables. Excluded targets could be included by mining the Makefile database `make -qp`, but such inclusion has a performance cost and is unnecessary due to the predominant use of `PHONY`.
