In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation.

The LAPACK-compliance and use of OpenCL simplify the use of clMAGMA in applications, while providing them with portably performant DLA. High performance is obtained through use of the high-performance OpenCL BLAS, hardware and OpenCL-specific tuning, and a hybridization methodology where we split the algorithm into computational tasks of various granularities. Execution of those tasks is properly scheduled over the heterogeneous hardware components by minimizing data movements and mapping algorithmic requirements to the architectural strengths of the various heterogeneous hardware components.},

For BTRD the average number of uniforms required to return one binomial deviate less between 2.5 and 1.4 which is considerably lower than for any of the known uniformly fast algorithms. Timings for a C-implementation show that for the case that the parameters of the binomial distribution vary from call to call BTRD is faster than the current state of the art algorithms.

	abstract = {We offer a procedure for generating a gamma variate as the cube of a suitably scaled normal variate. It is fast and simple, assuming one has a fast way to generate normal variables. In brief: generate a normal variate \\(x\\) and a uniform variate \\(U\\) until \\(\ln(U) < 0.5 + d - dv + \ln(v)\\), then return \\(dv\\). Here, the gamma parameter is \\(\alpha \geq 1\\), and \\(v = (1 + x/ *** with \\(d = \alpha - 1/3\\). The efficiency is high, exceeding \\(0.951, 0.981, 0.992, 0.996\\) at \\(\alpha = 1,2,4,8\\). The procedure can be made to run faster by means of a simple squeeze that avoids the two logarithms most of the time; return \\(dv\\) if \\(U < 1 - 0.0331\\). We give a short C program for any \\(\alpha \geq 1\\), and show how to boost an \\(\alpha \lt 1\\) into an \\(\alpha \gt 1\\). The gamma procedure is particularly fast for C implementation if the normal variate is generated in-line, via the #define feature. We include such an inline version, based on our ziggurat method. With it, and an inline uniform generator, gamma variates can be produced in 400MHz CPUs at better than 1.3 million per second, with the parameter \\(\alpha\\) changing from call to call.},

While the proposed methods are theoretically correct, we show that there are various design flaws in the uniform pseudo random number generators (PRNG's) of their published implementations for both the normal and Gamma distributions. These flaws lead to non-uniformity of the resulting pseudo-random numbers and consequently to noticeable deviations of their outputs from the required distributions. In addition, we show that the underlying uniform PRNG of the published implementation of MATLAB's \texttt{randn}, which is also based on the Ziggurat method, is not uniformly distributed with correlations between consecutive pairs. Also, we show that the simple linear initialization of the registers in MATLAB's \texttt{randn} may lead to non-trivial correlations between output sequences initialized with different (related or even random unrelated) seeds. These, in turn, may lead to erroneous results for stochastic simulations.},

In the algorithm, rectangular sampling domains are layered on top of each other (resembling a ziggurat) to encapsulate the desired probability density function. Random values within these layers are sampled and then returned if they lie beneath the graph of the probability density function. Here, we present an implementation where ziggurat layers reside completely beneath the probability density function, thereby eliminating the need for any rejection test within the ziggurat layers. In the new algorithm, small overhanging segments of probability density remain to the right of each ziggurat layer, which can be efficiently sampled with triangularly shaped sampling domains. Median runtimes of the new algorithm for exponential and normal variates is reduced to 58\% and 53\%, respectively (collective range: 41–93\%). An accessible C library, along with extensions into Python and MATLAB/Octave are provided.},

Our performance evaluation shows that simple, straightforward heuristics are superior to the more complex text-analysis-based algorithms.

An author's commit frequency describes how often that author commits. Knowing the distribution of all commit frequencies is a fundamental part of understanding software development processes. This paper presents a detailed quantitative analysis of commit frequencies in open-source software development. The analysis is based on a large sample of open source projects, and presents the overall distribution of commit frequencies.\n\nWe analyze the data to show the differences between authors and projects by project size; we also includes a comparison of successful and non successful projects and we derive an activity indicator from these analyses. By measuring a fundamental dimension of programming we help improve software development tools and our understanding of software development. We also validate some fundamental assumptions about software development.},

The focus of this thesis is to explore methods for downsampling data which can be visualized in the form of a line chart, for example, time series. Several algorithms are put forth in the thesis and their features are discussed. Also, an online survey was conducted where participants were asked to compare downsampled line charts against a non-downsampled chart. Some of the algorithms are based on a well-known technique in cartography which involves forming triangles between adjacent data points and using the area of the triangles to determine the perceptual importance of the individual points. According to the survey, algorithms based on a triangle area approach consistently proved to be effective, and one in particular when efficiency is also taken into account.},

	abstract = {Random numbers are critical in every aspect of cryptography. We need such numbers to encrypt e-mails, to digitally sign documents, for electronic payment systems, and so on. Unfortunately, true random numbers are very difficult to generate, especially on computers that are typically designed to be deterministic. This brings us to the concept of pseudo-random numbers, which are numbers generated from some random internal values, and that are very hard for an observer to distinguish from true random numbers. It is important to see the difference between the meaning of pseudo-random numbers in normal programming contexts, like simulation, e.g., where these numbers merely need to be reasonably random-looking and have good statistical properties, and in the context of cryptography, where they must be indistinguishable from real random numbers, even to observers with huge amount of computational resources. In the context of cryptography, a random number is a number that cannot be predicted by an observer before it is generated. Typically, if the number is to be in the range \\([0..n − 1]\\), an observer cannot predict that number with probability "slightly" better than \\(1/n\\). Or, we will see that the following is equivalent, if \\(m\\) random numbers are generated in a row, an observer given any \\(m − 1\\) of them still cannot predict the \\(m\\)'th with a probability significantly greater than \\(1/n\\_. In this work, we present first the notion of cryptographic secure pseudorandom bit generators (PRBG) in a formal way by using two different definitions. Then a theorem of Yao proving the equivalence of these two definitions is treated. In a second part, the Blum-Blum-Shub generator, a very simple and provably secure PRBG, is presented, with all the mathematical background needed to understand it. In the third part, the proof of its security is treated in details.},

The concrete security of this generator has been analyzed previously by Fischlin and Schnorr and by Knuth. In this paper we continue to analyse the concrete security the BBS generator. We show how to select both the size of the modulus and the number of bits extracted on each iteration such that a desired level of security is reached, while minimizing the computational effort per output bit. We will assume a concrete lower bound on the hardness of integer factoring, which is obtained by extrapolating the best factorization results to date. While for asymptotic security it suffices to give a polynomial time reduction a successful attack to factoring, we need for concrete security a reduction that is as efficient as possible. Our reduction algorithm relies on the techniques of Fischlin and Schnorr, as well as ideas of Vazirani and Vazirani, but combining these in a novel way for the case that more than one bit is output on each iteration.},

The \\(x^2 \bmod N\\) generator with inputs \\(N\\), \\(x_0\\) (where \\(N = P \cdot Q\\) is a product of distinct primes, each congruent to \\(3 \mod 4\\), and \\(x_0\\) is a quadratic residue \\(\bmod N\\)), outputs \\(b_0 b_1 b_2 \cdots \\) where \\(b_i = \operatorname{parity}(x_i )\\) and \\(x_{i + 1} = x_i^2 \bmod N\\). From short seeds each generator efficiently produces long well-distributed sequences. Moreover, both generators have computationally hard problems at their core. The first generator's sequences, however, are completely predictable (from any small segment of \\(2|P| + 1\\) consecutive digits one can infer the "seed," \\(P\\), and continue the sequence backwards and forwards), whereas the second, under a certain intractability assumption, is unpredictable in a precise sense. The second generator has additional interesting properties: from knowledge of \\(x_0\\) and \\(N\\) but not \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\), one can generate the sequence forwards, but, under the above-mentioned intractability assumption, one can not generate the sequence backwards. From the additional knowledge of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), one can generate the sequence backwards; one can even "jump" about from any point in the sequence to any other. Because of these properties, the \\(x^2 \bmod N\\) generator promises many interesting applications, e.g., to public-key cryptography. To use these generators in practice, an analysis is needed of various properties of these sequences such as their periods. This analysis is begun here.},

Set theory can serve as the basis for a specification language without types. This possibility, which has been widely overlooked, offers many advantages. Untyped set theory is simple and is more flexible than any simple typed formalism. Polymorphism, overloading, and subtyping can make a type system more powerful, but at the cost of increased complexity, and such refinements can never attain the flexibility of having no types at all. Typed formalisms have advantages, too, stemming from the power of mechanical type checking. While types serve little purpose in hand proofs, they do help with mechanized proofs. In the absence of verification, type checking can catch errors in specifications. It may be possible to have the best of both worlds by adding typing annotations to an untyped specification language.

Yet, little is known about performance issues that developers face in practice and they address these issues. This paper presents an empirical study of 98 fixed performance issues from 16 popular client-side and server-side JavaScript projects. We identify eight root causes of issues and show that inefficient usage of APIs is the most prevalent root cause. Furthermore, we find that most issues are addressed by optimizations that modify only a few lines of code, without significantly affecting the complexity of the source code. By studying the performance impact of optimizations on several versions of the SpiderMonkey and V8 engines, we find that only 42.68% of all optimizations improve performance consistently across all versions of both engines. Finally, we observe that many optimizations are instances of patterns applicable across projects, as evidenced by 139 previously unknown optimization opportunities that we find based on the patterns identified during the study. The results of the study help application developers to avoid common mistakes, researchers to develop performance-related techniques that address relevant problems, and engine developers to address prevalent bottleneck patterns.},

It states the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In other words, TF helps to measure how prepared is a project to deal with developer turnover. Despite its clear relevance, few studies explore this metric. Altogether there is no consensus about how to calculate it, and no supporting evidence backing estimates for systems in the wild. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel (and automated) approach for estimating TF-values, which we execute against a corpus of 133 popular project in GitHub. We later survey developers as a means to assess the reliability of our results. Among others, we find that the majority of our target systems (65%) have TF <= 2. Surveying developers from 67 target systems provides confidence towards our estimates; in 84% of the valid answers we collect, developers agree or partially agree that the TF's authors are the main authors of their systems; in 53% we receive a positive or partially positive answer regarding our estimated truck factors.},

Predicting by readability formulas, does not involve readers but instead uses counts of language elements in the piece of writing. This article reviews formulas and related predictive devices since 1960. Four categories are presented: 1) recalculations and revisions of existing formulas; 2) new formulas, for general purpose or special purpose use; 3) application aids, for both manual and machine use; and, 4) predictions of readability for foreign languages. It concludes with suggestions for choosing a formula, based upon the following considerations: 1) special versus general needs, 2) manual versus machine application, 3) simple versus complex formulas, 4) word length versus word list formulas; and, 5) sentence length versus sentence complexity. Finally, the article stresses that formulas provide good indices of difficulty, but do not indicate causes of difficulty or say how to write readably.},

@unpublished{miller:2008a,
	abstract = {For large UNIX projects, the traditional method of building the project is to use recursive make. On some projects, this results in build times which are unacceptably large, when all you want to do is change one file. In examining the source of the overly long build times, it became evident that a number of apparently unrelated problems combine to produce the delay, but on analysis all have the same root cause. This paper explores a number of problems regarding the use of recursive make, and shows that they are all symptoms of the same problem. Symptoms that the UNIX community have long accepted as a fact of life, but which need not be endured any longer. These problems include recursive makes which take "forever" to work out that they need to do nothing, recursive makes which do too much, or too little, recursive makes which are overly sensitive to changes in the source code and require constant Makefile intervention to keep them working. The resolution of these problems can be found by looking at what make does, from first principles, and then analyzing the effects of introducing recursive make to this activity. The analysis shows that the problem stems from the artificial partitioning of the build into separate subsets. This, in turn, leads to the symptoms described. To avoid the symptoms, it is only necessary to avoid the separation; to use a single make session to build the whole project, which is not quite the same as a single Makefile. This conclusion runs counter to much accumulated folk wisdom in building large projects on UNIX. Some of the main objections raised by this folk wisdom are examined and shown to be unfounded. The results of actual use are far more encouraging, with routine development performance improvements significantly faster than intuition may indicate, and without the intuitively expected compromise of modularity. The use of a whole project make is not as difficult to put into practice as it may at first appear.},

@article{hand:2006a,
	abstract = {A great many tools have been developed for supervised classification, ranging from early methods such as linear discriminant analysis through to modern developments such as neural networks and support vector machines. A large number of comparative studies have been conducted in attempts to establish the relative superiority of these methods. This paper argues that these comparisons often fail to take into account important aspects of real problems, so that the apparent superiority of more sophisticated methods may be something of an illusion. In particular, simple methods typically yield performance almost as good as more sophisticated methods, to the extent that the difference in performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that generally are not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm.},

One of the simplest sentiment analysis approaches compares the words of a posting against a labeled word list, where each word has been scored for valence, -- a 'sentiment lexicon' or 'affective word lists'. There exist several affective word lists, e.g., ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) developed before the advent of microblogging and sentiment analysis. I wanted to examine how well ANEW and other word lists performs for the detection of sentiment strength in microblog posts in comparison with a new word list specifically constructed for microblogs. I used manually labeled postings from Twitter scored for sentiment. Using a simple word matching I show that the new word list may perform better than ANEW, though not as good as the more elaborate approach found in SentiStrength.},

The basic measure of virality in Twitter is the probability of retweet and we are interested in which dimensions of the content of a tweet leads to retweeting. We hypothesize that negative news content is more likely to be retweeted, while for non-news tweets positive sentiments support virality. To test the hypothesis we analyze three corpora: A complete sample of tweets about the COP15 climate summit, a random sample of tweets, and a general text corpus including news. The latter allows us to train a classifier that can distinguish tweets that carry news and non-news information. We present evidence that negative sentiment enhances virality in the news segment, but not in the non-news segment. Our findings may be summarized 'If you want to be cited: Sweet talk your friends or serve bad news to the public'.},

	abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

There are now numerous Web sites containing such opinions, e.g., customer reviews of products, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. This paper focuses on online customer reviews of products. It makes two contributions. First, it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products. A prototype system called Opinion Observer is also implemented. The system is such that with a single glance of its visualization, the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features. This comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers. For a potential customer, he/she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products, which helps him/her to decide which product to buy. For a product manufacturer, the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information. Second, a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from Pros and Cons in a particular type of reviews. Such features form the basis for the above comparison. Experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly.},

The method guarantees that no overflow will occur unless at least one component of the quotient must overflow, otherwise the normwise error in the computed result is at most a few units in the last place. Moreover, the scaling requires only four floating point multiplications and a small amount of integer arithmetic to compute the scale factor. Thus, on many modern CPUs, our method is both safer and faster than Smith's widely used algorithm.},

Tensors are often sparse and compound operations must frequently be computed in a single kernel for performance and to save memory. Programmers are left to write kernels for every operation of interest, with different mixes of dense and sparse tensors in different formats. The combinations are infinite, which makes it impossible to manually implement and optimize them all. This paper introduces the first compiler technique to automatically generate kernels for any compound tensor algebra operation on dense and sparse tensors. The technique is implemented in a C++ library called taco. Its performance is competitive with best-in-class hand-optimized kernels in popular libraries, while supporting far more tensor operations.},

However, it may also enable attribution of successful attacks from code left behind on an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft, and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. In this work, we investigate machine learning methods to de-anonymize source code authors of C/C++ using coding style. Our Code Stylometry Feature Set is a novel representation of coding style found in source code that reflects coding style from properties derived from abstract syntax trees. Our random forest and abstract syntax tree-based approach attributes more authors (1,600 and 250) with significantly higher accuracy (94% and 98%) on a larger data set (Google Code Jam) than has been previously achieved. Furthermore, these novel features are robust, difficult to obfuscate, and can be used in other programming languages, such as Python. We also find that (i) the code resulting from difficult programming tasks is easier to attribute than easier tasks and (ii) skilled programmers (who can complete the more difficult tasks) are easier to attribute than less skilled programmers.},

In this paper, we examine the npm ecosystem from two complementary perspectives: 1) we look at package descriptions, the dependencies among them, and download metrics, and 2) we look at the use of npm packages in publicly available applications hosted on GitHub. In both perspectives, we consider historical data, providing us with a unique view on the evolution of the ecosystem. We present analyses that provide insights into the ecosystem's growth and activity, into conflicting measures of package popularity, and into the adoption of package versions over time. These insights help understand the evolution of npm, design better package recommendation engines, and can help developers understand how their packages are being used.},

@inproceedings{abdalkareem:2017a,
	abstract = {Code reuse is traditionally seen as good practice. Recent trends have pushed the concept of code reuse to an extreme, by using packages that implement simple and trivial tasks, which we call `trivial packages'. A recent incident where a trivial package led to the breakdown of some of the most popular web applications such as Facebook and Netflix made it imperative to question the growing use of trivial packages. Therefore, in this paper, we mine more than 230,000 npm packages and 38,000 JavaScript applications in order to study the prevalence of trivial packages. We found that trivial packages are common and are increasing in popularity, making up 16.8% of the studied npm packages. We performed a survey with 88 Node.js developers who use trivial packages to understand the reasons and drawbacks of their use. Our survey revealed that trivial packages are used because they are perceived to be well implemented and tested pieces of code. However, developers are concerned about maintaining and the risks of breakages due to the extra dependencies trivial packages introduce. To objectively verify the survey results, we empirically validate the most cited reason and drawback and find that, contrary to developers' beliefs, only 45.2% of trivial packages even have tests. However, trivial packages appear to be `deployment tested' and to have similar test, usage and community interest as non-trivial packages. On the other hand, we found that 11.5% of the studied trivial packages have more than 20 dependencies. Hence, developers should be careful about which trivial packages they decide to use.},

This paper evaluates four of the most popular algorithmic models used to estimate software costs (SLIM, COCOMO, Function Points, and ESTIMACS). Data on 15 large completed business data-processing projects were collected and used to test the accuracy of the models' ex post effort estimation. One important result was that Albrecht's Function Points effort estimation model was validated by the independent data provided in this study [3]. The models not developed in business data-processing environments showed significant need for calibration. As models of the software-development process, all of the models tested failed to sufficiently reflect the underlying factors affecting productivity.

We test our algorithm on a number of time-varying datasets of different physical phenomena. Explained variance curves indicate that our technique provides an excellent approximation to the original eigenspace computed using standard PCA in batch mode.

	abstract = {Zero has a usable sign bit on some computers, but not on others. This accident of computer arithmetic influences the definition and use of familiar complex elementary functions like square root, arctan and arccosh whose domains are the whole complex plane with a slit or two drawn in it. The Principal Values of those functions are defined in terms of the logarithm function from which they inherit discontinuities across the slit(s). These discontinuities are crucial for applications to conformal maps with corners. The behaviour of those functions on their slits can be read off immediately from defining Principal Expressions introduced in this paper for use by analysts. Also introduced herein are programs that implement the functions fairly accurately despite roundoff and other numerical exigencies. Except at logarithmic branch points, those functions can all be continuous up to and onto their boundary slits when zero has a sign that behaves as specified by IEEE standards for floating-point arithmetic; but those functions must be discontinuous on one side of each slit when zero is unsigned. Thus does the sign of zero lay down a trail from computer hardware through programming language compilers, run-time support libraries and applications programmers to, finally, mathematical analysts.},

	abstract = {The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is one of the most widely used measures of forecast accuracy, due to its advantages of scale-independency and interpretability. However, MAPE has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in MAPE, we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE). MAAPE has been developed through looking at MAPE from a different angle. In essence, MAAPE is a slope as an angle, while MAPE is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. MAAPE inherently preserves the philosophy of MAPE, overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of MAAPE are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data.},

	abstract = {Over half a century old and showing no signs of aging, k-means remains one of the most popular data processing algorithms. As is well-known, a proper initialization of k-means is crucial for obtaining a good final solution. The recently proposed k-means++ initialization algorithm achieves this, obtaining an initial set of centers that is provably close to the optimum solution. A major downside of the k-means++ is its inherent sequential nature, which limits its applicability to massive data: one must make k passes over the data to find a good initial set of centers. In this work we show how to drastically reduce the number of passes needed to obtain, in parallel, a good initialization. This is unlike prevailing efforts on parallelizing k-means that have mostly focused on the post-initialization phases of k-means. We prove that our proposed initialization algorithm k-means|| obtains a nearly optimal solution after a logarithmic number of passes, and then show that in practice a constant number of passes suffices. Experimental evaluation on real-world large-scale data demonstrates that k-means|| outperforms k-means++ in both sequential and parallel settings.},

We propose solutions for the first two problems, and a partial remedy for the third. Building on prior work for algorithmic acceleration that is not based on approximation, we introduce a new algorithm that efficiently, searches the space of cluster locations and number of clusters to optimize the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) measure. The innovations include two new ways of exploiting cached sufficient statistics and a new very efficient test that in one K-means sweep selects the most promising subset of classes for refinement. This gives rise to a fast, statistically founded algorithm that outputs both the number of classes and their parameters. Experiments show this technique reveals the true number of classes in the underlying distribution, and that it is much faster than repeatedly using accelerated K-means for different values of K.},

We motivate theoretically and experimentally the use of a deterministic divisive hierarchical method, which we refer to as PCA-Part (principal components analysis partitioning) for initialization. The criterion that K-means clustering minimizes is the SSE (sum-squared-error) criterion. The first principal direction (the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix) is the direction which contributes the largest SSE. Hence, a good candidate direction to project a cluster for splitting is, then, the first principal direction. This is the basis for PCA-Part initialization method. Our experiments reveal that generally PCA-Part leads K-means to generate clusters with SSE values close to the minimum SSE values obtained by one hundred random start runs. In addition, this deterministic initialization method often leads K-means to faster convergence (less iterations) compared to random methods. Furthermore, we also theoretically show and confirm experimentally on synthetic data when PCA-Part may fail.},

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.

To generate numbers with more than 32 bits in bit length, and particularly when converting into 53-bit double-precision floating-point numbers in [0,1) in the IEEE 754 format, the typical implementation concatenates two successive 32-bit integers and divides them by a power of 2. In this case, the 32-bit MT19937 is optimized in terms of its equidistribution properties (the so-called dimension of equidistribution with v-bit accuracy) under the assumption that one will mainly be using 32-bit output values, and hence the concatenation sometimes degrades the dimension of equidistribution compared with the simple use of 32-bit outputs. In this paper, we analyze such phenomena by investigating hidden 𝔽2-linear relations among the bits of high-dimensional outputs. Accordingly, we report that MT19937 with a specific lag set fails several statistical tests, such as the overlapping collision test, matrix rank test, and Hamming independence test.},

	abstract = {Security of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is an important research area in computer and communications sciences. Anomaly detection is a key challenge in ensuring the security of WSN. Several anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed and validated recently using labeled datasets that are not publicly available. Our group proposed an ellipsoid-based anomaly detection algorithm but demonstrated its performance using synthetic datasets and real Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory and Grand St. Bernard datasets which are not labeled with anomalies. This approach requires manual assignment of the anomalies' positions based on visual estimates for performance evaluation. In this paper, we have implemented a single-hop and multi-hop sensor-data collection network. In both scenarios we generated real labeled data for anomaly detection and identified different types of anomalies. These labeled sensor data and types of anomalies are useful for research, such as machine learning, and this information will be disseminated to the research community.},

	abstract = {As a preparation step to compute Jacobian elliptic functions efficiently, we created a fast method to calculate the complete elliptic integral of the first and second kinds, K(m) and E(m), for the standard domain of the elliptic parameter, 0 < m < 1. For the case 0 < m < 0.9, the method utilizes 10 pairs of approximate polynomials of the order of 9--19 obtained by truncating Taylor series expansions of the integrals. Otherwise, the associate integrals, K(1 − m) and E(1 − m), are first computed by a pair of the approximate polynomials and then transformed to K(m) and E(m) by means of Jacobi's nome, q, and Legendre's identity relation. In average, the new method runs more-than-twice faster than the existing methods including Cody's Chebyshev polynomial approximation of Hastings type and Innes' formulation based on q-series expansions. Next, we invented a fast procedure to compute simultaneously three Jacobian elliptic functions, sn(u|m), cn(u|m), and dn(u|m), by repeated usage of the double argument formulae starting from the Maclaurin series expansions with respect to the elliptic argument, u, after its domain is reduced to the standard range, 0 ≤ u < K(m)/4, with the help of the new method to compute K(m). The new procedure is 25--70{\%} faster than the methods based on the Gauss transformation such as Bulirsch's algorithm, sncndn, quoted in the Numerical Recipes even if the acceleration of computation of K(m) is not taken into account.},

It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps.

The first algorithm adapts to the condition number of the sum; i.e., the computing time is proportional to the difficulty of the problem.

By “online” we mean that the algorithm needs to see only one input at a time, and can take an arbitrary length input stream of such inputs while requiring only constant memory. By “exact” we mean that the sum of the internal array of our algorithm is exactly equal to the sum of all the inputs, and the returned result is the correctly-rounded sum. The proof of correctness is valid for all inputs (including nonnormalized numbers but modulo intermediate overflow), and is independent of the number of summands or the condition number of the sum. The algorithm asymptotically needs only 5 FLOPs per summand, and due to instruction-level parallelism runs only about 2--3 times slower than the obvious, fast-but-dumb “ordinary recursive summation” loop when the number of summands is greater than 10,000. Thus, to our knowledge, it is the fastest, most accurate, and most memory efficient among known algorithms. Indeed, it is difficult to see how a faster algorithm or one requiring significantly fewer FLOPs could exist without hardware improvements.

In this paper, we study a popular incremental technique originally proposed by Welford, which we extend to weighted covariance and correlation. We also discuss strategies for further improving numerical precision, how to compute such statistics online on a data stream, with exponential aging, with missing data, and a batch parallelization for both high performance and numerical precision. We demonstrate when the numerical instability arises, and the performance of different approaches under these conditions. We showcase applications from the classic computation of variance as well as advanced applications such as stock market analysis with exponentially weighted moving models and Gaussian mixture modeling for cluster analysis that all benefit from this approach.},

	abstract = {Several algorithms for computation of basic statistics are compared by their performance on systematically generated test data. The statistics calculated were the mean, standard deviation and correlation coefficient. For each statistic, the algorithm included the usual computing formulas, correction due to an accumulated error term, and a recursive computation of the current value of the statistic. The usual computing formulas were also evaluated in double precision. Large errors were noted for some calculation using the usual computing formulas. The most reliable technique was correction of the initial estimate by use of an accumulated error term. To eliminate the need for making two passes on the data, it was suggested that the initial estimate of the mean be obtained from a subset of the data.},

	abstract = {A direct relationship between Shellsort and the classical "problem of Frobenius" from additive number theory is used to derive a sequence of O(log N) increments for Shellsort for which the worst case running time is O(N^(4/3)). The previous best-known upper bound for sequences of O(log N) increments was O(N^(3/2)), which was shown by Pratt to be tight for a large family of sequences, including those commonly used in practice. The new upper bound is of theoretical interest because it suggests that increment sequences might exist which admit even better upper bounds, and of practical interest because the increment sequences which arise outperform those common used, even for random files.},
