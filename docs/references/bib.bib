Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation.

In particular, these are linear system solvers and eigenvalue problem solvers. Further, we give an overview of the clMAGMA library, an open source, high performance OpenCL library that incorporates the developments presented, and in general provides to heterogeneous architectures the DLA functionality of the popular LAPACK library. The LAPACK-compliance and use of OpenCL simplify the use of clMAGMA in applications, while providing them with portably performant DLA. High performance is obtained through use of the high-performance OpenCL BLAS, hardware and OpenCL-specific tuning, and a hybridization methodology where we split the algorithm into computational tasks of various granularities. Execution of those tasks is properly scheduled over the heterogeneous hardware components by minimizing data movements and mapping algorithmic requirements to the architectural strengths of the various heterogeneous hardware components.},

For BTRD the average number of uniforms required to return one binomial deviate less between 2.5 and 1.4 which is considerably lower than for any of the known uniformly fast algorithms. Timings for a C-implementation show that for the case that the parameters of the binomial distribution vary from call to call BTRD is faster than the current state of the art algorithms.

	abstract = {We offer a procedure for generating a gamma variate as the cube of a suitably scaled normal variate. It is fast and simple, assuming one has a fast way to generate normal variables. In brief: generate a normal variate \\(x\\) and a uniform variate \\(U\\) until \\(\ln(U) < 0.5 + d - dv + \ln(v)\\), then return \\(dv\\). Here, the gamma parameter is \\(\alpha \geq 1\\), and \\(v = (1 + x/ *** with \\(d = \alpha - 1/3\\). The efficiency is high, exceeding \\(0.951, 0.981, 0.992, 0.996\\) at \\(\alpha = 1,2,4,8\\). The procedure can be made to run faster by means of a simple squeeze that avoids the two logarithms most of the time; return \\(dv\\) if \\(U < 1 - 0.0331\\). We give a short C program for any \\(\alpha \geq 1\\), and show how to boost an \\(\alpha \lt 1\\) into an \\(\alpha \gt 1\\). The gamma procedure is particularly fast for C implementation if the normal variate is generated in-line, via the #define feature. We include such an inline version, based on our ziggurat method. With it, and an inline uniform generator, gamma variates can be produced in 400MHz CPUs at better than 1.3 million per second, with the parameter \\(\alpha\\) changing from call to call.},

While the proposed methods are theoretically correct, we show that there are various design flaws in the uniform pseudo random number generators (PRNG's) of their published implementations for both the normal and Gamma distributions. These flaws lead to non-uniformity of the resulting pseudo-random numbers and consequently to noticeable deviations of their outputs from the required distributions. In addition, we show that the underlying uniform PRNG of the published implementation of MATLAB's \texttt{randn}, which is also based on the Ziggurat method, is not uniformly distributed with correlations between consecutive pairs. Also, we show that the simple linear initialization of the registers in MATLAB's \texttt{randn} may lead to non-trivial correlations between output sequences initialized with different (related or even random unrelated) seeds. These, in turn, may lead to erroneous results for stochastic simulations.},

    abstract = {The ziggurat algorithm is a very fast rejection sampling method for generating pseudorandom numbers (PRNs) from statistical distributions. In the algorithm, rectangular sampling domains are layered on top of each other (resembling a ziggurat) to encapsulate the desired probability density function. Random values within these layers are sampled and then returned if they lie beneath the graph of the probability density function. Here, we present an implementation where ziggurat layers reside completely beneath the probability density function, thereby eliminating the need for any rejection test within the ziggurat layers. In the new algorithm, small overhanging segments of probability density remain to the right of each ziggurat layer, which can be efficiently sampled with triangularly shaped sampling domains. Median runtimes of the new algorithm for exponential and normal variates is reduced to 58\% and 53\%, respectively (collective range: 41–93\%). An accessible C library, along with extensions into Python and MATLAB/Octave are provided.},

Our performance evaluation shows that simple, straightforward heuristics are superior to the more complex text-analysis-based algorithms. Not only are the heuristics significantly faster to compute, they also deliver more accurate results when estimating commit sizes. Based on this experience, we design and present an algorithm that improves on the heuristics, can be computed equally fast, and is more accurate than any of the prior approaches.},

This can be a somewhat challenging enterprise for large amounts of data and might require downsampling the data, retaining only the important visual characteristics. The focus of this thesis is to explore methods for downsampling data which can be visualized in the form of a line chart, for example, time series. Several algorithms are put forth in the thesis and their features are discussed. Also, an online survey was conducted where participants were asked to compare downsampled line charts against a non-downsampled chart. Some of the algorithms are based on a well-known technique in cartography which involves forming triangles between adjacent data points and using the area of the triangles to determine the perceptual importance of the individual points. According to the survey, algorithms based on a triangle area approach consistently proved to be effective, and one in particular when efficiency is also taken into account.},

	abstract = {Random numbers are critical in every aspect of cryptography. We need such numbers to encrypt e-mails, to digitally sign documents, for electronic payment systems, and so on. Unfortunately, true random numbers are very difficult to generate, especially on computers that are typically designed to be deterministic. This brings us to the concept of pseudo-random numbers, which are numbers generated from some random internal values, and that are very hard for an observer to distinguish from true random numbers. It is important to see the difference between the meaning of pseudo-random numbers in normal programming contexts, like simulation, e.g., where these numbers merely need to be reasonably random-looking and have good statistical properties, and in the context of cryptography, where they must be indistinguishable from real random numbers, even to observers with huge amount of computational resources. In the context of cryptography, a random number is a number that cannot be predicted by an observer before it is generated. Typically, if the number is to be in the range \\([0..n − 1]\\), an observer cannot predict that number with probability "slightly" better than \\(1/n\\). Or, we will see that the following is equivalent, if \\(m\\) random numbers are generated in a row, an observer given any \\(m − 1\\) of them still cannot predict the \\(m\\)'th with a probability significantly greater than \\(1/n\\_. In this work, we present first the notion of cryptographic secure pseudorandom bit generators (PRBG) in a formal way by using two different definitions. Then a theorem of Yao proving the equivalence of these two definitions is treated. In a second part, the Blum-Blum-Shub generator, a very simple and provably secure PRBG, is presented, with all the mathematical background needed to understand it. In the third part, the proof of its security is treated in details.},

The concrete security of this generator has been analyzed previously by Fischlin and Schnorr and by Knuth. In this paper we continue to analyse the concrete security the BBS generator. We show how to select both the size of the modulus and the number of bits extracted on each iteration such that a desired level of security is reached, while minimizing the computational effort per output bit. We will assume a concrete lower bound on the hardness of integer factoring, which is obtained by extrapolating the best factorization results to date. While for asymptotic security it suffices to give a polynomial time reduction a successful attack to factoring, we need for concrete security a reduction that is as efficient as possible. Our reduction algorithm relies on the techniques of Fischlin and Schnorr, as well as ideas of Vazirani and Vazirani, but combining these in a novel way for the case that more than one bit is output on each iteration.},

The \\(x^2 \bmod N\\) generator with inputs \\(N\\), \\(x_0\\) (where \\(N = P \cdot Q\\) is a product of distinct primes, each congruent to \\(3 \mod 4\\), and \\(x_0\\) is a quadratic residue \\(\bmod N\\)), outputs \\(b_0 b_1 b_2 \cdots \\) where \\(b_i = \operatorname{parity}(x_i )\\) and \\(x_{i + 1} = x_i^2 \bmod N\\). From short seeds each generator efficiently produces long well-distributed sequences. Moreover, both generators have computationally hard problems at their core. The first generator's sequences, however, are completely predictable (from any small segment of \\(2|P| + 1\\) consecutive digits one can infer the "seed," \\(P\\), and continue the sequence backwards and forwards), whereas the second, under a certain intractability assumption, is unpredictable in a precise sense. The second generator has additional interesting properties: from knowledge of \\(x_0\\) and \\(N\\) but not \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\), one can generate the sequence forwards, but, under the above-mentioned intractability assumption, one can not generate the sequence backwards. From the additional knowledge of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), one can generate the sequence backwards; one can even "jump" about from any point in the sequence to any other. Because of these properties, the \\(x^2 \bmod N\\) generator promises many interesting applications, e.g., to public-key cryptography. To use these generators in practice, an analysis is needed of various properties of these sequences such as their periods. This analysis is begun here.},

	abstract = {Most specification languages have a type system. Type systems are hard to get right, and getting them wrong can lead to inconsistencies. Set theory can serve as the basis for a specification language without types. This possibility, which has been widely overlooked, offers many advantages. Untyped set theory is simple and is more flexible than any simple typed formalism. Polymorphism, overloading, and subtyping can make a type system more powerful, but at the cost of increased complexity, and such refinements can never attain the flexibility of having no types at all. Typed formalisms have advantages, too, stemming from the power of mechanical type checking. While types serve little purpose in hand proofs, they do help with mechanized proofs. In the absence of verification, type checking can catch errors in specifications. It may be possible to have the best of both worlds by adding typing annotations to an untyped specification language. We consider only specification languages, not programming languages.},

Yet, little is known about performance issues that developers face in practice and they address these issues. This paper presents an empirical study of 98 fixed performance issues from 16 popular client-side and server-side JavaScript projects. We identify eight root causes of issues and show that inefficient usage of APIs is the most prevalent root cause. Furthermore, we find that most issues are addressed by optimizations that modify only a few lines of code, without significantly affecting the complexity of the source code. By studying the performance impact of optimizations on several versions of the SpiderMonkey and V8 engines, we find that only 42.68% of all optimizations improve performance consistently across all versions of both engines. Finally, we observe that many optimizations are instances of patterns applicable across projects, as evidenced by 139 previously unknown optimization opportunities that we find based on the patterns identified during the study. The results of the study help application developers to avoid common mistakes, researchers to develop performance-related techniques that address relevant problems, and engine developers to address prevalent bottleneck patterns.},

It states the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In other words, TF helps to measure how prepared is a project to deal with developer turnover. Despite its clear relevance, few studies explore this metric. Altogether there is no consensus about how to calculate it, and no supporting evidence backing estimates for systems in the wild. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel (and automated) approach for estimating TF-values, which we execute against a corpus of 133 popular project in GitHub. We later survey developers as a means to assess the reliability of our results. Among others, we find that the majority of our target systems (65%) have TF <= 2. Surveying developers from 67 target systems provides confidence towards our estimates; in 84% of the valid answers we collect, developers agree or partially agree that the TF's authors are the main authors of their systems; in 53% we receive a positive or partially positive answer regarding our estimated truck factors.},

Predicting by readability formulas, does not involve readers but instead uses counts of language elements in the piece of writing. This article reviews formulas and related predictive devices since 1960. Four categories are presented: 1) recalculations and revisions of existing formulas; 2) new formulas, for general purpose or special purpose use; 3) application aids, for both manual and machine use; and, 4) predictions of readability for foreign languages. It concludes with suggestions for choosing a formula, based upon the following considerations: 1) special versus general needs, 2) manual versus machine application, 3) simple versus complex formulas, 4) word length versus word list formulas; and, 5) sentence length versus sentence complexity. Finally, the article stresses that formulas provide good indices of difficulty, but do not indicate causes of difficulty or say how to write readably.},

	abstract = {For large UNIX projects, the traditional method of building the project is to use recursive make. On some projects, this results in build times which are unacceptably large, when all you want to do is change one file. In examining the source of the overly long build times, it became evident that a number of apparently unrelated problems combine to produce the delay, but on analysis all have the same root cause. This paper explores a number of problems regarding the use of recursive make, and shows that they are all symptoms of the same problem. Symptoms that the UNIX community have long accepted as a fact of life, but which need not be endured any longer. These problems include recursive makes which take "forever" to work out that they need to do nothing, recursive makes which do too much, or too little, recursive makes which are overly sensitive to changes in the source code and require constant Makefile intervention to keep them working. The resolution of these problems can be found by looking at what make does, from first principles, and then analyzing the effects of introducing recursive make to this activity. The analysis shows that the problem stems from the artificial partitioning of the build into separate subsets. This, in turn, leads to the symptoms described. To avoid the symptoms, it is only necessary to avoid the separation; to use a single make session to build the whole project, which is not quite the same as a single Makefile. This conclusion runs counter to much accumulated folk wisdom in building large projects on UNIX. Some of the main objections raised by this folk wisdom are examined and shown to be unfounded. The results of actual use are far more encouraging, with routine development performance improvements significantly faster than intuition may indicate, and without the intuitively expected compromise of modularity. The use of a whole project make is not as difficult to put into practice as it may at first appear.},

There exist several affective word lists, e.g., ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) developed before the advent of microblogging and sentiment analysis. I wanted to examine how well ANEW and other word lists performs for the detection of sentiment strength in microblog posts in comparison with a new word list specifically constructed for microblogs.

The basic measure of virality in Twitter is the probability of retweet and we are interested in which dimensions of the content of a tweet leads to retweeting. We hypothesize that negative news content is more likely to be retweeted, while for non-news tweets positive sentiments support virality. To test the hypothesis we analyze three corpora: A complete sample of tweets about the COP15 climate summit, a random sample of tweets, and a general text corpus including news. The latter allows us to train a classifier that can distinguish tweets that carry news and non-news information. We present evidence that negative sentiment enhances virality in the news segment, but not in the non-news segment.

@article{higham:1993a,
	abstract = {The usual recursive summation technique is just one of several ways of computing the sum of \\(n\\) floating point numbers. Five summation methods and their variations are analyzed here. The accuracy of the methods is compared using rounding error analysis and numerical experiments. Four of the methods are shown to be special cases of a general class of methods, and an error analysis is given for this class. No one method is uniformly more accurate than the others, but some guidelines are given on the choice of method in particular cases.},

We construct a model that explains how these strongly nonideal statistics can arise from environmental fluctuations, and also justifies our proposed strategy. We implement this strategy in the BenchmarkTools Julia package, where it is used in production continuous integration (CI) pipelines for developing the Julia language and its ecosystem.},

This document presents two improved complex division algorithms. We present a proof of the robustness of the first improved algorithm. Numerical simulations show that this algorithm performs well in practice and is significantly more robust than other known implementations. By combining additional scaling methods with this first algorithm, we were able to create a second algorithm, which rarely fails.},
