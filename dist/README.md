> Distributable files.

<!-- Section to include introductory text. Make sure to keep an empty line after the intro `section` element and another before the `/section` close. -->

<section class="intro">

This directory contains packages exporting distributable files for use in browser environments or as shared ("vendored") libraries in server environments. Each distributable file is a standalone [UMD][umd] bundle which, if no recognized module system is present, will expose bundle contents to the global scope.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

First, install one of the packages in this directory containing distributable files. For example, to install the main [stdlib][stdlib] bundle

```bash
$ npm install --save @stdlib/dist-flat
```

To use a package's default bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/node_modules/@stdlib/dist-<pkg>"></script>
```

where `dist-<pkg>` corresponds to the desired published distributable file package.

To use a specific bundle (e.g., un-minified), include the bundle file path

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/node_modules/@stdlib/dist-<pkg>/build/<bundle>.js"></script>
```

where `<bundle>` corresponds to the desired bundle. For example, to include the un-minified bundle found in the package used in the example above

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/@stdlib/dist-flat/build/bundle.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope. For example, assuming the flat namespace bundle sourced above,

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    // `stdlib` is a global variable...
    var erf = stdlib.base.erf;
    console.log( erf( 0.5 ) );
</script>
```

## Notes

-   Bundles are one of two namespace types: `flat` or `tree`. A `tree` namespace is a nested object namespace which mirrors the project's layout (e.g., `stdlib.math.base.special.erf`). A `flat` namespace uses the global alias [namespace][@stdlib/namespace], where each package has a unique alias (e.g., `stdlib.base.erf`). Which namespace is preferred depends on personal taste and application context.

-   Each minified bundle has a corresponding [gzip][gzip]-compressed bundle. The [gzip][gzip] compression level for each compressed bundle is `9`, which is the highest (and most optimal) compression level. Deciding between uncompressed and compressed bundles depends on the application and whether compression is handled elsewhere in the application stack (e.g., [nginx][nginx], [CDN][cdn], _et cetera_).

-   While you are **strongly** encouraged to **vendor** bundles and host with a [CDN][cdn]/provider which can provide availability **guarantees**, especially for production applications, bundles are available via [unpkg][unpkg] for quick demos, proof-of-concepts, and instructional material. For example,

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@stdlib/dist-flat"></script>
    ```

    Please be mindful that [unpkg][unpkg] is a free, best-effort service relying on donated infrastructure which does **not** provide **any** availability guarantees. Under **no** circumstances should you **abuse** or **misuse** the service. You have been **warned**.

-   If you intend on embedding a standalone bundle **within** another bundle, you may need to rename `require` calls within the standalone bundle **before** bundling in order to maintain scoped module resolution. For example, if you plan on using [browserify][browserify] to generate a bundle containing embedded bundles, [browserify][browserify] plugins exist to "de-require" those bundles prior to bundling.
