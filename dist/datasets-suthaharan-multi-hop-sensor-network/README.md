<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var dataset = require( '@stdlib/dist-datasets-suthaharan-multi-hop-sensor-network' ).SUTHAHARAN_MULTI_HOP_SENSOR_NETWORK;
```

#### dataset()

Returns a dataset consisting of labeled wireless sensor network data set collected from a multi-hop wireless sensor network deployment using TelosB motes.

```javascript
var data = dataset();
/* returns
    [
        {
            'reading': 1,
            'mote_id': 1,
            'indoor': 0,
            'humidity': 43.82,
            'temperature': 30.21,
            'label': 0
        },
        ...
    ]
*/

## Notes

-   Humidity and temperature measurements were collected at `5` second intervals over a six hour period on July 10, 2010.

-   Temperature is in degrees Celsius.

-   Humidity is temperature corrected relative humidity, ranging from 0-100%.

-   The label `0` denotes normal data, and the label `1` denotes an introduced event.

-   If a mote was an indoor sensor, the corresponding indicator is `1`. If a mote was an outdoor sensor, the indoor indicator is `0`.

-   This package contains distributable files for use in browser environments or as shared ("vendored") libraries in server environments. Each distributable file is a standalone [UMD][umd] bundle which, if no recognized module system is present, will expose bundle contents to the global scope.

-   Each minified bundle has a corresponding [gzip][gzip]-compressed bundle. The [gzip][gzip] compression level for each compressed bundle is `9`, which is the highest (and most optimal) compression level. Deciding between uncompressed and compressed bundles depends on the application and whether compression is handled elsewhere in the application stack (e.g., [nginx][nginx], [CDN][cdn], _et cetera_).

-   While you are **strongly** encouraged to **vendor** bundles and host with a [CDN][cdn]/provider which can provide availability **guarantees**, especially for production applications, bundles are available via [unpkg][unpkg] for quick demos, proof-of-concepts, and instructional material. For example,

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@stdlib/dist-datasets-suthaharan-multi-hop-sensor-network"></script>
    ```

    Please be mindful that [unpkg][unpkg] is a free, best-effort service relying on donated infrastructure which does **not** provide **any** availability guarantees. Under **no** circumstances should you **abuse** or **misuse** the service. You have been **warned**.

-   If you intend on embedding a standalone bundle **within** another bundle, you may need to rename `require` calls within the standalone bundle **before** bundling in order to maintain scoped module resolution. For example, if you plan on using [browserify][browserify] to generate a bundle containing embedded bundles, [browserify][browserify] plugins exist to "de-require" those bundles prior to bundling.

-   The bundles in this package expose the following [stdlib][stdlib] packages:

    -   [@stdlib/datasets/suthaharan-multi-hop-sensor-network][@stdlib/datasets/suthaharan-multi-hop-sensor-network]

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var incrgrubbs = require( '@stdlib/stats/incr/grubbs' );
var data = require( '@stdlib/dist-datasets-suthaharan-multi-hop-sensor-network' ).SUTHAHARAN_MULTI_HOP_SENSOR_NETWORK;

var acc;
var d;
var i;
var j;
var k;

// Get the sensor data:
d = data();

// For each mote, test for an outlier temperature measurement...
i = 0;
for ( j = 0; j < 4; j++ ) {
    k = j + 1;

    // Create a new accumulator for performing Grubbs' test:
    acc = incrgrubbs();

    // Update the accumulator with temperature data...
    while ( i < d.length && d[ i ].mote_id === k ) {
        acc( d[ i ].temperature );
        i += 1;
    }
    // Print test results:
    console.log( '' );
    console.log( 'Mote: %d', k );
    console.log( '' );
    console.log( acc().print() );
}
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/@stdlib/dist-datasets-suthaharan-multi-hop-sensor-network/build/bundle.min.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    // If no recognized module system present, exposed to global scope:
    var dataset = stdlib_datasets_suthaharan_multi_hop_sensor_network.SUTHAHARAN_MULTI_HOP_SENSOR_NETWORK;
    console.log( dataset() );
</script>
```
